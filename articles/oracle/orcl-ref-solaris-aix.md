# Compatibility with Solaris and AIX

> [!IMPORTANT]
> UKCloud for Oracle Software has been retired from sale by UKCloud. We'll continue to support all existing customers who are using this service, however, we are no longer providing this service for new workloads. This article provides existing UKCloud for Oracle Software customers with access to support documentation and we'll continue to update it as required. For new Oracle requests, contact your Client Director or Service Delivery Manager.

## Overview

This article provides advice about how you can migrate your applications to UKCloud for Oracle Software depending on the Oracle platform you're using.

## Solaris and AIX compatibility

Use the diagram below to determine if your current platform is compatible with our Oracle cloud.

## Solaris x86

Solaris x86 is compatible with our Oracle cloud service so you can bring your Solaris workload to us. We provide a Solaris x86 template for you to use to build your Oracle virtual machines.

You may need to talk to your Service Delivery Manager or Cloud Architect to help with the specifics of the project.

## AIX

As AIX is tied to IBM hardware, it's not possible to run natively in our Oracle cloud. However, with the correct scoping and technical assistance, it may be possible to transform the application stack to be OVM-compatible.

If you want to use UKCloud for Oracle Software with AIX, contact your Service Delivery Manager or Cloud Architect to discuss how this could be achieved.

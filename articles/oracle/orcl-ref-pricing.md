# Pricing information for UKCloud for Oracle Software

## Overview

UKCloud for Oracle Software VM pricing can be as low as 9p per hour. Full pricing with all options, including licensing and connectivity, is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

Oracle workloads are priced per hour for compute resources, and monthly for storage. Your bills are based on the resources you actually allocate to your solution. In contrast to traditional hosting models, this ensures that there's no lock-in to unnecessarily licensed or under-utilised hardware.

Our flexible pricing enables you map neatly to your existing specifications and scale resources up or down based on new or changing requirements. You're not constrained to the resources identified in an early design phase.

## Licensing

UKCloud for Oracle Software includes the base OVM licences, which provide VM containers that meet Oracle's definition of hard partitioning.

Our service doesn't include licences for the Oracle applications and databases you choose to run. As the underlying platform is powered by OVM technology, you can either transfer your existing licences, or confidently buy new licences based on the quantity of virtual processors you allocate within each VM.

If you need help defining the best licensing approach for your situation, we can introduce you to one of our partners who specialise in Oracle licensing compliance, optimisation and fulfillment.

## Pricing example

**Oracle flavour:** x86<br>
**Machine size:** 2 cores<sup>*</sup>, 4GiB RAM<br>
**Storage used:** 100GiB Tier 2 block storage

<sup>*</sup> Cores refers to physical processor cores.

**VM cost per month**

An Oracle x86 VM costs **£0.075** per core per hour and **£0.015** per GiB RAM per hour.

So, an Oracle x86 VM with 2 cores and 4GiB RAM costs (2 x £0.075) + (4 x £0.015) = £0.15 + £0.06 = **£0.21** per hour.

In an average **730** hour month, the monthly VM cost works out at 730 x £0.21 = **£153.30**.

**Storage cost per month**

Tier 2 costs **£0.10** per GiB per month.

100GiB of additional storage costs **£10.00** per month.

**Total basic cost**

Calculate the total basic cost by adding together the monthly VM and storage costs.

VM cost per month | + | Storage cost per month | = | Total basic cost
------------------|---|------------------------|---|-----------------
£153.30           | + | £10.00                 | = | **£163.30**

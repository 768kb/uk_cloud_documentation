# UKCloud for Oracle Software Service Definition

## What is UKCloud for Oracle Software?

UKCloud for Oracle Software provides a proven Oracle Infrastructure as a Service that's tailor made for running your Oracle workloads in the cloud. This service enables you to move technologies such as Oracle Database, Oracle WebLogic Server, Oracle Primavera, E-Business Suite and more to our secure sovereign cloud platform quickly and easily, while enjoying the economies of scale of the cloud. You can then connect your Oracle applications to the non-Oracle workloads that you have within the rest of the multi-cloud ecosystem. It is billed hourly and supported free of charge.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Overcome licencing barriers of putting Oracle software in the cloud using Oracle hypervisor technology

- Achieve your data centre modernisation strategy by moving both legacy and modern Oracle workloads to the cloud

- Streamline Oracle licensing by adjusting VM resources to suit performance and only licence the CPU cores used

- Improve data locality by having your Oracle workloads next to your other cloud workloads

- Ensure business continuity by using UKCloud for Oracle Software as part of your disaster recovery strategy

## Product options

The service is designed to be flexible and enables you to mix and match from a range of pre-defined options for each virtual machine and change them when required.

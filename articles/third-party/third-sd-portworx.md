# Portworx Enterprise from UKCloud Service Definition

## What is Portworx Enterprise from UKCloud?

The service provides a secure and stable cloud native storage and data management platform for Kubernetes that enterprises can trust to manage data in containers.

Kubernetes is the fastest growing open source project in history, but Kubernetes was not designed with stateful applications like databases in mind. For enterprise applications, these systems have non-negotiable business requirements like high availability, data security, disaster recovery, strict performance SLAs and hybrid/multi-cloud operations. Portworx Enterprise addresses all these requirements enabling the adoption of Kubernetes for mission critical enterprise and traditional/legacy applications.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Improve cloud native storage flexibility and agility

  - Container-optimized volumes with elastic scaling (no application downtime)

  - Application aware I/O tuning

  - Auto-scaling

  - Improve cloud native storage resilience

  - Read/write multi-attachment of persistent data volumes

  - Automated failover of volumes across nodes

  - Application-consistent snapshots – on-demand and schedule based

  - Scanning drives for media errors, alerting and repairing 

- Improve cloud native storage security

  - Cluster-wide encryption

  - Role-based access control

  - Container-granular or storage-class based Bring Your Own Kubernetes (BYOK) encryption

- Cloud native disaster recovery and workload migrations

  - Multi-cloud/multi-cluster app migrations

  - Snapshot to cloud

  - Multi-site synchronous replication for zero recovery point objective disaster recovery

  - Multi-site asynchronous replication across the WAN

  - Integration with managed K8S services (EKS, AKS, GKE, PKS, IKS, RKE)

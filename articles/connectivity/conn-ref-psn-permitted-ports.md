# PSN Assured - permitted standard ports

The following whitelist of common ports will be open as standard on the platform and allow connectivity to/from the PSN network. This policy has been built in accordance with version 2.3(2) of the PSN IL2 GCSX Take on Guide.

Customers still need to enable access on their own edge gateway firewalls to allow access but this change avoids having to request UKCloud to make similar changes.

Customers are encouraged to review their edge configurations to verify that the access controls that are in place are in accordance with their own required security policy.

This whitelist policy applies to the Assured OFFICIAL platform only where connectivity is established over PSN using PSN routable addresses.

If you require access outside of the standard whitelist this can be requested via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal.

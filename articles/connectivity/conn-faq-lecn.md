# Law Enforcement Community Network (LECN) FAQs

## What is the Law Enforcement Community Network?

The Law Enforcement Community Network (LECN) is a new network being created by the Home Office. This network will replace the PSN for Policing (PSNfP) network, which is going end-of-life in 2022 (originally planned for end of 2021).

## When will the LECN be a live network?

The LECN is being rolled-out for existing services using the PSNfP. If you're already using the PSNfP, you should have been contacted by the Home Office to arrange a migration. If you use PSNfP and haven't been contacted by Home Office yet, let your UKCloud Service Delivery Manager know and we can contact Home Office on your behalf.

## Will UKCloud have connectivity to the LECN?

We're currently working with the LECN team within Home Office to understand how the network will be presented to consumers so that we can enable connectivity that works in a way for the LECN service provider and our customers.

At the current time, we're not yet sure exactly how we'll present the LECN to our customers, but as per the presentation of our existing networks, we'll aim to use either either multi-tenant (like our PSN connections) or individual connections (like our MCN connections).

## What compliance requirements will there be for access to LECN?

The LECN doesn't have a compliance regime like PSN does. Compliance requirements will be driven by a specific service requirement, such as providing a service exclusively to UK policing, which requires connectivity to the network. The services themselves will have assurance requirements driven by UK policing assurance standards from the National Policing Information Risk Management Team (NPIRMT), so each connected service may have slightly different connection compliance requirements.

## What will the cost of access to LECN be?

Cost will largely be dictated by the method of presentation of LECN to UKCloud, so we aren't sure at this moment. We'll update this article when we know more.

## I have a new service that I need to make available to policing right now, can I use LECN?

If you have an immediate requirement to present a new service to the policing community, let us know and we'll work with you and the LECN team in the Home Office to understand the best way to get you connected to your policing end users. It could be that you'll need to use the PSNfP initially before migrating, depending on timescales of LECN rollout, but this will be defined by the Home Office.

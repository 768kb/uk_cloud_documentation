# PowerCLI command for interacting with the vCloud API

To establish a connection to VMware Cloud Director using PowerShell, use the following command:

    Connect-CIServer -Server <API-URL> -Org <ORG-ID> -User <USERNAME> -Password <PASSWORD>

You can find the details for API-URL, ORG-ID, and USERNAME in the UKCloud Portal, under the API section of the top right menu.

> [!NOTE]
> Remove `@<ORG-ID>` from the username that is listed on the UKCloud Portal API page, as it is not required when attempting to login with this command.

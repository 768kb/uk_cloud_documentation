# Sharing catalogs FAQs

## Can you share a catalogue between vOrgs?

It is possible to share catalogs between vOrgs, and this can be processed by the UKCloud support team. For the request to be valid and for the support team to complete the sharing, the following rules apply:

- The requester must be an organisation administrator for both the source and destination organisations

- UKCloud will not revoke or delete a shared catalog

- UKCloud will only set a shared catalog to read only permissions for the destination organisations

## Where does a shared catalog appear and what does it look like?

A shared catalog appears in the public catalog on the destination vOrg, but will appear in my organisation catalog in the source vOrg.

## Who can access the shared catalog?

For information on permissions you as the customer can select, see:

- [VMware Cloud Director 10.3](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Service-Provider-Admin-Portal-Guide/GUID-BC504F6B-3D38-4F25-AACF-ED584063754F.html)

## How many vOrgs can a catalog be shared with?

A catalog can be shared with as many vOrgs as required.

## Can I still have independent catalogs as well as shared catalogs?

Yes.

## What information does the UKCloud support team need in order for us to request a shared catalog?

To share a catalog, UKCloud requires the source vOrg ID, destination vOrg ID and catalog name.

## Can I delete a shared catalog?

You can delete the contents of a shared catalog as long as you have full control of the catalog, but you will be unable to delete an actual shared catalog.

## Who can update a shared catalog?

For information on permissions you as the customer can select, see:

- [VMware Cloud Director 10.3](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Service-Provider-Admin-Portal-Guide/GUID-BC504F6B-3D38-4F25-AACF-ED584063754F.html)

## Overview

To route traffic to your external network (for example internet, PSN), you need to know your  external IP addresses.

To find your allocated external IP address range:

1. In the VMware Cloud Director *Virtual Data Center* dashboard, select the VDC that contains the edge gateway.

2. In the left navigation panel, under *Networking*, select **Edges**.

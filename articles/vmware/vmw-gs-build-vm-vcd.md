# How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware

## Overview

This article leads you through the three basic steps for using UKCloud for VMware to quickly build a simple virtual machine (VM) in VMware Cloud Director, and connect it to the internet.

For more information about how to use other Cloud Director functions to make the most of UKCloud for VMware and create more complex virtual data centres (VDCs), take a look at the [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware*](vmw-gs.md).

The three steps covered in this article are:

1. Create a network (to move requests around your VMs)

2. Configure the edge gateway (in this article we focus on the firewall and NAT configuration)

3. Create a VM

If you follow these steps, you can have a VM up and running with a connection to the internet in about 20 to 25 minutes.

## Before you begin

You should have received your UKCloud Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator.

You should have created a compute service and VDC within your account. For more information, see the [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware*](vmw-gs.md#creating-your-ukcloud-for-vmware-estate).

You should also have created an edge gateway, which enables communication between your VDC and the outside world. For more information, see [*How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal*](vmw-how-build-edge.md).

To perform the tasks in this article, you'll need to open Cloud Director:

1. [*Log in to the UKCloud Portal*](../portal/ptl-gs.md).

2. If necessary, select your account.

3. In the Portal navigation panel, expand **VMware Cloud** and then select the compute service in which you want to create your VM.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you haven't created a compute service yet, see the [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware*](vmw-gs.md#building-a-compute-service).

4. On the **VMware Cloud Director** tab, enter your Portal password and click **Confirm**.

    ![VMware Cloud Director tab in UKCloud Portal](images/vmw-portal-vcd-login.png)

## Create a network

Before you can start building VMs in your VDC, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other and the outside world.

First, you need to create a network that can connect to external networks outside your VDC (including the internet). This is called an *external routed network*. You can find more information about routed networks in [*How to create a routed VDC network*](vmw-how-create-routed-network.md).

1. In the vCloud Director *Virtual Datacenters* dashboard, select your VDC.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you haven't created a VDC yet, see the [*Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware*](vmw-gs.md#building-a-virtual-data-centre).

2. You're creating a network, so, in the left navigation panel, select **Networks**.

   ![Network menu option](images/vmw-vcd10.1-tab-networks.png)

3. To create a new network, click the **New** button.

   ![New network button](images/vmw-vcd10.1-btn-new-network.png)

4. You want your VM to connect to the internet (rather than just other VMs in the same VDC), so in the *Network Type* page of the *New Organization VDC Network* dialog box, select **Routed**.

   ![New Organization VDC Network dialog box - Network Type - Routed](images/vmw-vcd10.1-new-network-routed-type.png)

5. Click **Next**.

6. In the *General* page, give the network a **Name** and **Description**.

7. In the **Gateway CIDR** field, enter the details for the gateway address.

8. The **Shared** option enables you to make your network available to other VDCs within the same region so that VMs can communicate with each other, regardless of which VDC they are in. For example, you may have a single repository server that provides updates for all the VMs in a region.

   For the purposes of this tutorial, leave the **Shared** option deselected.

   ![New Organization VDC Network dialog box - General](images/vmw-vcd10.1-new-network-general-ex.png)

9. Click **Next**.

10. When you connect a network to the outside world, it's important that you control exactly what can access your environment via that network. UKCloud for VMware uses edge gateways to do this.

    In the *Edge Connection* page, select the edge that you want your new network to use (we'll work more with the edge gateway later on).

    ![New Organization VDC Network dialog box - Edge Connection](images/vmw-vcd10.1-new-network-routed-edge-ex.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you haven't created an edge gateway, see [*How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal*](vmw-how-build-edge.md).

11. For the purposes of this tutorial, you can ignore the other fields on this page, so click **Next**.

12. A VM needs an IP address to identify it on the network.

    In the *Static IP Pools* page, identify the range of IP addresses that VMs connecting to this network can use then click **Add**. For example, if your **Gateway CIDR** is `192.168.1.1/24`, you can use the `192.168.1.10-192.168.1.100` range for your static IP pool, giving 91 usable internal IP addresses.

    ![New Organization VDC Network dialog box - Static IP Pools](images/vmw-vcd10.1-new-network-ip-pool-ex.png)

13. Click **Next**.

14. In the *DNS* page, enter your DNS information.

    ![New Organization VDC Network dialog box - DNS](images/vmw-vcd10.1-new-network-dns.png)

15. Click **Next**.

16. In the *Ready to Complete* page, review your selections then click **Finish**.

    ![New Organization VDC Network dialog box - Ready to Complete](images/vmw-vcd10.1-new-network-ready-ex.png)

## Configure the edge gateway

The edge gateway is possibly the most complex part of the VDC because of its high level of functionality. The following steps show you how to quickly configure the edge gateway to enable you to access the internet from a VM.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NAT rules only work if the firewall is enabled. For security reasons, you should ensure that the firewall is always enabled.

1. In the vCloud Director *Virtual Datacenters* dashboard, select your VDC.

2. This time you're working with the edge gateway, so in the left navigation panel, click **Edges**.

    ![Edges menu option in vCloud Director](images/vmw-vcd-mnu-edges.png)

3. Select the edge gateway you want to work with and click the **Configure Services** button.

    ![Configure Services button](images/vmw-vcd-edge-btn-config.png)

4. Each tab in the *Edge Gateway* dialog box provides access to a different service provided by the edge gateway. The main tabs are:

    ![Tabs on the Edge Gateway dialog box](images/vmw-vcd-edge-tabs.png)

    - **Firewall** - As well as a physical firewall, you can control which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway. You'll set up some firewall rules later in this exercise.

    - **DHCP** - The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to Org networks connected to an edge. The DHCP tab shows DHCP information for any VDC networks that have been configured with DHCP, and so acts as a centralised view. For more information, see [*How to create a DHCP pool*](vmw-how-create-dhcp-pool.md).

    - **NAT** - Network address translation, both in (DNAT) and out (SNAT) of the edge gateway. You'll set up some NAT rules later in this exercise.

    - **Routing** - You can provide static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example networks in other VDCs in your compute service. For more information, see [*How to create a static route*](vmw-how-create-static-route.md).

    - **Load Balancer** - The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin. For more information, see [*How to configure a load balancer*](vmw-how-configure-load-balancer.md).

    - **VPN** - IPsec site‑to‑site VPN is available on the edge gateway. You can configure an IPsec VPN within vCloud Director, but you may need to perform additional configuration through the API. For more information, see [*How to configure IPsec VPN*](vmw-how-configure-ipsec-vpn.md).

    To access the internet from a VM, you'll need to create firewall rules to determine who can access your network and NAT rules to route traffic within your network.

### Creating firewall rules

Let's start with firewall rules:

1. In the *Edge Gateway* dialog box, select the **Firewall** tab.

2. Make sure the **Enabled** option is selected.

    ![Enabled option on Firewall tab](images/vmw-vcd-adv-edge-firewall-enabled.png)

3. Click the **+** button to add a new row to the firewall rules table.

    ![Add button on Firewall tab](images/vmw-vcd-adv-edge-firewall-add.png)

4. Edit the values in the row for the **New Rule** using the settings below:

    - **Name** - `HTTPS outbound`

    - **Source** - `internal`

        Click **+** (Add object) button, select **Internal**, click the right arrow button, then click **Keep**.

    - **Destination** - `external`

        Click **+** (Add object) button, select **External**, click the right arrow button, then click **Keep**.

    - **Service** - Click the **+** button and enter the following values in the *Add Service* dialog box
  
      - **Protocol** - **TCP**

      - **Source Port** - `any`

      - **Destination Port** - `443`

        ![Add Service dialog box](images/vmw-vcd-edge-firewall-add-service.png)

      Click **Keep** when you're done.

    - **Action** - **Accept**

    These settings allow traffic from the VMs (**Source** = `internal`) to reach destinations outside your VDC (**Destination** = `external`) on port `443` (HTTPS). You'll need to repeat these steps for ports `80` (HTTP) and `53` (DNS).

    > [!NOTE]
    > For DNS, the protocol should be UDP.

    You can also allow traffic to reach your VMs from outside your VDC by swapping the **Source** and **Destination** values. However, because this opens up your firewall to a lot of traffic, we recommend that you first complete this guide to get comfortable with general networking concepts, and then take a look at the information in [*How to create firewall rules*](vmw-how-create-firewall-rules.md) where you can find out how to lock the firewall down.

    ![New firewall rule](images/vmw-vcd-edge-firewall-new-rule.png)

5. Click **Save changes**.

    ![Save changes link on Firewall tab](images/vmw-vcd-adv-edge-firewall-save.png)

### Creating NAT rules

Now that you've set up the firewall rules, you can create NAT rules:

1. In the *Edge Gateways* dialog box, select the **NAT** tab.

    ![NAT tab in vCloud Director](images/vmw-vcd-edge-tab-nat.png)

2. In the *NAT44 Rules* section, click the **SNAT Rule** button to create a source NAT (SNAT) rule to translate internal IP addresses into something that the external network can understand.

    ![Add SNAT Rule button](images/vmw-vcd-btn-add-snat.png)

3. In the *Add SNAT Rule* dialog box, from the **Applied on** list, choose the edge gateway to which you want to apply the SNAT rule.

4. In the **Original Source IP/Range** field, enter the range of addresses you created when you created the network in the previous exercise.

5. In the **Translated Source IP/Range** field, enter one or more of the external IP addresses provided to you by UKCloud.

    If you are not sure what your IP addresses are, see [*How to find your allocated external IP addresses*](vmw-how-find-ip-addresses.md).

    ![Add SNAT Rule dialog box](images/vmw-vcd-edge-snat-add.png)

6. When you're done, click **Keep** and then **Save changes**.

    ![Save changes link on NAT tab](images/vmw-vcd-edge-nat-save.png)

    You can also add destination NAT (DNAT) rules to translate external IP addresses to route traffic to the appropriate internal addresses. However, because the firewall only provides outbound access to the internet, we don't need to add DNAT rules at the moment.

    You can find more information about setting up NAT rules in [*How to create NAT rules*](vmw-how-create-nat-rules.md).

## Create a virtual machine

Now that you've laid the groundwork, it's time to create your VM. The best way to do this is to create a virtual application (vApp). You can think of a vApp as a container for your VMs; it enables you to group related VMs together to manage them in one place. See [*How to create a vApp*](vmw-how-create-vapp.md) to find out more.

1. In the vCloud Director *Virtual Datacenters* dashboard, select your VDC.

2. In the left navigation panel, click **vApps**.

    ![vApps menu option in vCloud Director](images/vmw-vcd-tab-vapps.png)

3. In this exercise, you'll create the vApp from scratch, so click **New vApp**.

    ![New vApp button](images/vmw-vcd-btn-new-vapp.png)

4. In the *New vApp* dialog box, give the vApp a **Name** and **Description**.

5. Click **Add Virtual Machine**.

    ![Add Virtual Machine button in New vApp dialog box](images/vmw-vcd-btn-add-vm-new.png)

6. In the *New VM* dialog box, you can create your VM. Enter a **Name**, **Computer Name** and **Description** for the VM.

    > [!TIP]
    > The **Name** is to identify the VM, the **Computer Name** is the host name of the VM.
    >
    > The **Computer Name** is copied from the **Name** field but can contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens so you may need to edit it if your VM **Name** contains spaces or special characters.

7. The easiest way to create a VM is to use a pre-built template from a catalog, so from the **Type** radio buttons, select **From Template**.

8. From the list of **Templates**, select the one you want to use.

9. Click **OK*.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > By default, the **Power on** check box is selected for new VMs. If you do not want the VM to power on and start incurring charges immediately, make sure to deselect this check box.

10. Back in the *New vApp* dialog box, you can add more VMs if you want, but for now click **Create** to create the vApp and the single VM.

11. There are some more configuration tasks to complete for your new VM, so in the left navigation panel, select **Virtual Machines** to list all the VMs in the VDC.

    ![Virtual Machines menu option](images/vmw-vcd-tab-vms.png)

12. In the card for your new VM, click **Details**.

13. In the *General* section, you can change the VM name in the **Name** field, but keep the default **Storage Policy** option.

    ![VM details General section](images/vmw-vcd-vm-details-general.png)

14. Expand the *Hardware* section and, in the **NICs** section, click **Add** and select the externally routed **Network** you created in the first exercise.

15. From the **IP Mode** list, choose **Static - IP Pool** to use the IP pool you defined earlier when you created your network.

    ![VM details Hardware section](images/vmw-vcd-vm-details-hardware.png)

16. You don't need to change anything in the other sections, so click **Save**.

17. If your VM is not already powered on, in the card for the VM, select **Actions** then **Power On**.

18. Click the monitor icon to open the popout console and go through the setup procedure.

    ![Monitor icon to start popout console](images/vmw-vcd91-ico-console.png)

19. To confirm that you have connectivity to the internet and have an assigned IP address:

    - Type `ipconfig` into the Command Prompt. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VM will return an IP address.

    - Open an internet browser page and navigate to an external web page

    - Ping the IP address of your DNS (for example, `8.8.8.8`) through the command line.

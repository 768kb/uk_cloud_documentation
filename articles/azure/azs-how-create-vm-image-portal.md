# How to create a custom image from a VM on Azure Stack Hub using the UKCloud Azure Stack Hub portal

## Overview

You can create an image resource from a generalised virtual machine (VM) that is stored as either a managed disk or an unmanaged disk in a storage account. You can then use the image to create multiple VMs.

This article explains how to create a custom image from a VM on Azure Stack Hub, which you can then use to deploy other VMs.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this article, you must have appropriate access to a subscription in the Azure Stack Hub portal.

## Generalise your VM

> [!WARNING]
> Once you've generalised a VM, you **cannot** log back into it.

### [Windows](#tab/tabid-a)

1. Log in to your Windows VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

2. Open a PowerShell console or command prompt as administrator and run the following command: `C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\sysprep.exe`

3. In the *System Preparation Tool*, from the **System Cleanup Action** list, select **Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)**.

4. Ensure the **Generalise** check box is selected.

5. From the **Shutdown Options** list, select **Shutdown**.

    See the image below for an example:

    ![Windows sysprep example](images/azs-windows-sys-prep.png)

6. Click **OK** and wait for the VM to shutdown. Your RDP session will be closed.

    > [!TIP]
    > The generalisation process is complete once your VM is in a stopped state.

### [Linux](#tab/tabid-b)

1. Log in to your Linux VM using Secure Shell (SSH).

2. Run the following command: `sudo su` and enter your user password if prompted.

3. Run the following command: `waagent -deprovision+user -force`

4. Wait a minute for the generalisation process to complete before continuing.

## Creating the image

### [Managed Disk](#tab/tabid-c)

> [!WARNING]
> Capturing a VM image will make the VM unusable and **cannot** be undone.

1. Log in to the [Azure Stack Hub portal](https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/).

    For more detailed instructions, see [Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure](azs-gs.md).

2. In the *favourites* panel, select **Virtual machines**.

3. In the *Virtual machines* blade, select the VM that you want to capture.

4. In the top menu, click **Capture**.

5. In the *Create image* blade, provide a **Name** for the new image.

6. From the **Resource group** list, select an existing resource group, or create a new one by clicking the **Create new** link and then typing a name for your new resource group in the pop out window.

7. Select **Automatically delete this virtual machine after creating the image**.

8. In the **Type the virtual machine name** field, enter the VM name.

9. Click **Create**.

10. Wait for the image creation process to finish.

11. Once complete, your VM image will appear in the resource group you selected in step 6.

12. Click the VM image.

13. In the *new* page, click **Create VM**.

    ![Create VM from image](images/azs-browser-create-vm-from-image.png)

14. Enter a **Name**, **Username**, **Authentication type**, **Password** and **Resource group** for the new VM, then click **OK**.

15. Select a VM size then click **Select**.

16. In *Configure optional features*, under *Select public inbound ports*, select the ports you want to open.

17. Click **OK**.

18. Review the *Summary* blade and click **OK**. The new VM will now begin deployment.

### [Unmanaged Disk](#tab/tabid-d)

> [!CAUTION]
> It is not possible to capture a VM image from the portal for a unmanaged disk VM.
> However, it is possible using [PowerShell](azs-how-create-vm-image-powershell.md).

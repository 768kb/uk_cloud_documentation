# Methods for exporting data

## Overview

This guide provides some general information about how you can export data away from the UKCloud platform. You have access to copy or export your data at any point in life working with UKCloud and further options may exist that are not covered here.

## Before you begin

You can package and export your data in a number of different ways, however we recommend that you read the following documents:

- [How to use the VMware OVF Tool](../vmware/vmw-how-use-ovf-tool.md) - Provides guidance on using the OVF tool, which you can use to export data from VMware

- [Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage](../cloud-storage/cs-gs.md) - Covers the use of APIs for accessing our storage service

## Exporting data

You can use any of the following methods to export data:

- Internet, government secure network or leased line data copy

- Mass Transfer Facility

- Customer-hosted equipment

### Internet, government secure network or leased line data copy

All customers have some form of connectivity to the UKCloud platform to consume services, whether that be an internet facing connection or through one of the approved or government secure network connections. These connections are used for the management of services and may also have been used for copying data to the UKCloud platform. Therefore, the first option for exporting data is to make use of these existing connections.

### Mass Transfer Facility (UKCloud)

We can copy data from your environment to, typically, removable media (NAS, HDD, USB) provided by you.

For more information about booking and using this service, see the [Mass Transfer Facility Service Scope](../enablement/enbl-sco-mtf-nas.md).

### Customer-hosted equipment

Where you have hosted equipment at a UKCloud data centre for part of the solution, for example the hosting of communications equipment, you can also leverage this in a similar way to the data room. If you have equipment hosted at UKCloud, you may request access using a normal Service Request via the [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the UKCloud Portal.

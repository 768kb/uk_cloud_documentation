# Multi-Cloud Backup Storage Service Definition

## What is Multi-Cloud Backup Storage?

UKCloud's Multi-Cloud Backup Storage gives customers a backup target that is accessible from every cloud within UKCloud's multi-cloud platform, as well as being an off-site target for any on-premises data backup. This service utilises a technology that is common across backup products such as Veritas NetBackup/Backup Exec and Veeam, along with native hooks for database backups from Oracle, DB2, SQL Server and Hadoop. In addition, this service can be attached as a backup target within your file system, enabling a wide array of applications to utilise this backup service.

## What the service can help you achieve

- Lower your overhead of managing complex and expensive backup storage infrastructure

- Lower Recovery Time Objective (RTO) for backup recovery through more granular or application aware backup applications

- Quicker database recovery, directly from backup target to database

- Greater control over backups using your own self-service backup applications

## Product options

The service is designed to be flexible and allows you to mix and match from a range of pre-defined options and change them when required.

# Understanding UKCloud service maintenance windows

## Overview

To monitor the availability and overall health of the UKCloud platform, including any Planned or Emergency maintenance, see the [UKCloud Service Status page](https://status.ukcloud.com/).

## Planned Maintenance

Planned Maintenance means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability, depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, UKCloud shall provide affected customers with at least 14 days' notice of the Planned Maintenance.

As far as possible, Planned Maintenance shall be planned in such a way to minimise the impact to customers and maximise the amount of work that can be achieved safely.

If, during Planned Maintenance, there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the Planned Maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. For information about whether Planned Maintenance-related SLA events will be included in the availability calculation for a particular service and be eligible for Service Credits, see the [*SLA definition*](other-ref-sla-definition.md).

## Emergency Maintenance

Emergency Maintenance means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure related to the service. Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability, depending on the nature of the activity required.

As far as possible, UKCloud shall:

- Provide affected customers with at least 6 hours' advance notice of Emergency Maintenance

- Carry out the Emergency Maintenance between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday, or between the hours of Saturday 00:00 to Monday 06:00 (UK local time), including bank holidays, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer environments.

If, during Emergency Maintenance, there is a loss of availability to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. This time will included in monthly service reporting related to the service, but will be excluded from the availability calculation and will not be eligible for Service Credits.

Any changes to this Connection Agreement shall be subject to the change control procedures as available at the HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services section and may be updated from time-to-time by the HSCN Authority

**1 Entitlement to connect to and use the HSCN**

1.1 Connection to the HSCN is provided based on the business need to share information within the health and social care community.

1.2 However, to protect the availability of the HSCN as a shared resource for the health and social care system, where (in its sole discretion) the HSCN Authority has concerns in respect of the cyber security, information assurance or information governance arrangements of an organisation applying for a HSCN service it reserves the right to:

1.2.1 refuse a HSCN service if such HSCN service is not already in place;

1.2.2 restrict or modify access under a HSCN service to the HSCN Authority's systems, services or applications (including National Applications); or

1.2.3 terminate a HSCN service.

1.3 Despite the HSCN Authority's rights set out above, its preference shall be to work with a HSCN Consumer to identity and rectify root cause security issues to avoid terminating a HSCN service where possible.

1.4 However, if evidence emerges of activity or behaviour by a HSCN Consumer in relation to the use of the HSCN that would undermine the availability of the HSCN, damage the reputation of the HSCN, the NHS or Her Majesty's Government, or otherwise pose a security threat to the organisation or other HSCN Consumers or providers of the HSCN, the HSCN Authority may have no choice other than to terminate the HSCN service.

**2 Security Considerations for the HSCN**

2.1 The primary security consideration of the HSCN is to make sure that it is available as a resource to carry information between providers in the health and social care community.  There is a secondary requirement to maintain and to improve a good standard of information governance and cyber-security across the health and social care community.  This will help to reduce the exposure of the NHS and wider health and social care providers to the kinds of cyber-attack and loss of personal data that has been widely reported in the media in the last few years.

2.2 It is important that each HSCN Consumer (where necessary working with or through its IT partners, suppliers, or other HSCN Consumers):

2.2.1 works with the HSCN Authority, HSCN Suppliers, and other members of the health and social care community to help each of these requirements be realised and, in the event that a security incident – including cyber-attack or malware outbreak - is detected or suspected, works (collaboratively where necessary) to help contain the problem, minimise the impact, subsequently resolve it and then to help prevent a re-occurrence;

2.2.2 ensures that each and every other organisation which routes traffic through the HSCN Consumer's own HSCN connection:

2.2.2.1 has signed and submitted to the HSCN Authority an HSCN Connection Agreement; or

2.2.2.2 is otherwise made subject to legally binding terms identical to those set out in this Connection Agreement (which the HSCN Authority may require the HSCN Consumer to verify in writing at any time); and  

2.2.3 has technical measures in place to prevent organisations that have not signed a Connection Agreement (or are not subject to terms identical to those set out in this Connection Agreement) in accordance with clause 2.2.2 are prevented from routing traffic to the HSCN through that HSCN Connection.

**3 HSCN Authority's obligations under this Connection Agreement**

3.1 The HSCN Authority commits to:

3.1.1 work with HSCN Consumers to help improve and maintain good cyber security and good data handling processes. This includes communicating updates to good cyber security, information governance and other related guidance to its HSCN Consumers; and

3.1.2 inform HSCN Consumers in a timely manner of any incident or security matter that the HSCN reasonably believes will have a negative impact on the connection to the HSCN.

**4 HSCN Consumer Obligations**

4.1 Whilst there are no specific assurance or compliance regimes to which HSCN Consumers must adhere in order to obtain a connection to the HSCN, there are a number of obligations on all organisations that use the HSCN. These are designed to help maintain the availability of the HSCN whilst improving the overall cyber security position of HSCN Consumers and continuing to protect personal information about patients and service users.

**_Incident Reporting_**

4.2 In the event of a security incident which relates to Your use of the HSCN or Your connection to the HSCN, You agree that You (or a partner working on Your behalf, for example, a system supplier, or IT supplier) will:

4.2.1 conduct initial diagnosis of the incident to determine which service is the cause (or most likely cause of the incident);

4.2.2 raise the incident with Us for the affected service, who will then raise it with the CN-SP;

4.2.3 at the earliest opportunity inform the HSCN Authority through the mechanism for notifying security incidents as set out on the HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services section and to complete actions assigned by the HSCN Authority or its representatives in an agreed timeframe to support containment and resolution of the incident;

4.2.4 if the HSCN Data Security Centre team contacts You to help resolve an incident or problem, You must respond as You would for one of Your own customers or users;  

4.2.5 depending on the nature of the incident, provide audit logs holding user activities, exceptions and information security events to assist in investigations; and

4.2.6 where appropriate, notify other HSCN Consumers with whom You share a HSCN service of any incident that has been communicated to You by the HSCN Supplier or the HSCN Authority.

4.3 Where an incident occurs relating to the use of the HSCN by another HSCN Consumer or HSCN Supplier or You reasonably suspect an incident has occurred, You agree that You will notify the HSCN Authority at the earliest opportunity using the contact information set out on the HSCN website.

**_Cyber and Information Security_**

4.4 All HSCN Consumers have a duty, through the implementation of robust data handling and information security practices:

4.4.1 to be 'good citizens' to help ensure that the HSCN remains available for all users; and

4.4.2 a wider duty to protect their information, systems and services from unauthorised disclosure, destruction, theft, unavailability or loss of integrity through cyber and / or other forms of attack. In some cases, this duty is set out in law, in others it is what service users and patients might reasonably expect of organisations that hold, control or process personal or personal sensitive information about them.

4.5 You acknowledge that your organisation has been notified of this information and your responsibilities to implement good information security.

**_Network Monitoring_**

4.6 The HSCN Consumer agrees that the HSCN Authority Network Analytic Service will monitor the connection point between their networks and the HSCN for the purposes of maintaining the availability of the HSCN, systems and / or services that are available through the HSCN, and the connection between the HSCN and the internet.  Examples include looking for abnormal amounts of traffic that could indicate a malware or other cyber security attack.

4.7 However, the HSCN Authority Network Analytic Service does not look at or store the content of network traffic.

4.8 The HSCN Consumer agrees that the HSCN Authority's Advanced Network Monitoring Service will monitor and inspect, through signature and behavioural analysis, the content of unencrypted internet-bound traffic to look for evidence of malicious or suspicious content.  The HSCN Consumer acknowledges that the operation of this service involves the analysis of the content of internet traffic, including Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data.

4.8.1 **"Controller"**, **"Processor"**, **"Data Subject"**, **"Personal Data Breach"** and **"Processing"** shall have the same meanings as in the Data Protection Laws and **"Processed"** and **"Process"** shall be construed in accordance with the definition of "Processing".  **"Personal Data"** and **"Sensitive Personal Data"** shall have the same meaning as in the Data Protection Laws, and shall refer to Personal Data (or Sensitive Personal Data) provided by the HSCN Consumer to the HSCN Authority in connection with this Connection Agreement, or as otherwise Processed by the HSCN Authority in relation to the services offered to the HSCN Consumer in connection with HSCN.

4.9 For the avoidance of doubt, the HSCN Authority shall have no liability to the HSCN Consumer in respect of the functioning or non-functioning of the HSCN Authority Network Analytic Service and/or the HSCN Authority's Advanced Network Monitoring Service.

**_Securing information_**

4.10 Each HSCN Consumer acknowledges that:

4.10.1 the HSCN's primary requirement is to be available as a means for sharing information between the health and social care community;

4.10.2 the HSCN does not help secure data in any way as it passes across the network.  Responsibility for providing sufficient security lies with the sending and receiving organisation, or the providers and users of sites or applications that are accessed through the HSCN.  This includes providing assurances that any service or application available on the HSCN or any organisations or users on the network are authentic and appropriately secured; and

4.10.3 the HSCN does not warrant the authenticity of any service, system or data available through the HSCN or of any information received through the HSCN.

**_Access Controls_**

4.11 Because there is sometimes a business need to access a variety of content from a range of services, the HSCN network does not impose any restrictions on categories of sites or services that HSCN Consumers can access through the HSCN, except that:

4.11.1 for internet access, a standard set of controls are in place to prevent data from being shared with known malware resources (for example, places on the internet with which malware may try to communicate with). The purpose of this restriction is to limit the impact on the HSCN community should a malware attack take place, and as such the list of blocked sites may change from time to time; and

4.11.2 HSCN Consumers may agree access restrictions on internet access or general network access (for example, blocks on categories of internet sites) with Us, but that is a solely a matter between the HSCN Consumers and Us.

**_HSCN Service Information_**

4.12 Each HSCN Consumer agrees to provide and maintain (through their connection profile information posted at the HSCN Website – Providers of NHS Services section):

4.12.1 whether their connection to the HSCN is shared with any other organisations (whether health and social care or not) and if so the identity of those organisations; and

4.12.2 the following contacts at the HSCN Consumer:

4.12.2.1 the business sponsor of the connection – this contact should be in a senior position in the organisation who is ultimately responsible for the use of the HSCN Connectivity Services (e.g. Chief Information Officer); and

4.12.2.2 security lead with whom the HSCN Authority can communicate security information.  This individual may be the Senior Information Risk Officer (SIRO), Caldicott Guardian, Chief Security Officer or of equivalent standing and responsibility.  For some HSCN Consumers, this may be a contact at for example, a partner organisation such as an IT systems supplier or shared service provider who handles security matters for the HSCN Consumer.  

**_Information Governance – NHS Digital National Applications_**

4.13 The HSCN Consumer shall comply with all applicable information governance requirements in order to handle patient data, and access systems, services and resources that are available through the HSCN.  

4.14 For the NHS Digital National Applications, this is currently the Data Security & Protection Toolkit (DSPT). For other systems and services, local arrangements may apply.

4.15 By accepting the terms of the Connection Agreement, You are agreeing to comply with requirements and arrangements for those systems and services which you will access or make use of through the HSCN.  

4.16 The current arrangements for the NHS Digital National Applications are set out here: <https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk>. HSCN Consumers should check with organisations that provide systems and services that they use as to local arrangements that are in place.

4.17 The HSCN Consumer shall comply with all relevant policies, guidelines or directions from time to time made available on the HSCN Data Security Centre websites, accessible at the following locations (and/or via any replacement sites identified by the HSCN Authority from time to time):  

4.17.1 <https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-and-cyber-security-protecting-information-and-data-in-health-and-care>; and

4.17.2 <http://systems.digital.nhs.uk/infogov>.

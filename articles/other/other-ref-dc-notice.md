# Data centre advance notice requirements

You can arrange to visit a data centre in either Farnborough or Corsham to carry out maintenance or service existing hardware. Access to our data centres is available from Monday to Friday.

This article outlines the notice period and process for requests to visit one of our data centres. 

## Advance notice period

For all requests to visit a data centre the minimum advance notice period is 24 hours (subject to all required information being provided in the request). Requests for access on a Monday must be submitted by 12:00 (noon) at the latest on the previous Friday.

Visitors to the data centre must have valid government issued, photographic ID (for example, a passport or driving licence) and have the combination code for all racks that need to be accessed.

> [!NOTE]
> All visitors will be escorted during their visit.

## Creating a request to visit the data centre

To create a request to visit a data centre, raise a service request in the [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the UKCloud Portal.

For customers requiring a new installation of hardware into one of the data centres, a new request must be submitted via [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti), which will involve engagement with a UKCloud technical architect for design and to set up networking. Data centre access cannot be arranged until this review has been completed, so please advise us as soon as possible.

When we confirm your request, we'll let you know any specific details for access.

# G-Cloud 12 - Our enhancements and additions

## Summary

### What is the UKCloud theme for G-Cloud 12?

Our portfolio of multi-cloud services has been further enhanced at G-Cloud 12 to accelerate the government's legacy IT transformation programme. This expanded portfolio has been designed to overcome the resource, assurance, availability and commercial constraints that often stop public sector organisations reaching their digital transformation objectives.  

### When will the changes take effect?

All existing customer solutions will automatically benefit from the service improvements and new service options from 28th September 2020. Updated Service Definitions for updated and new services are available via the [UKCloud Knowledge Centre](https://docs.ukcloud.com/articles/other/other-ref-service-definitions.html) and the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/).

### Can I retain my G-Cloud 11 service?

Yes, you will still receive the same service, with the improvements and enhancements we've made for G-Cloud 12. Note that for some new options in G-Cloud 12 there may be an additional charge.

### If I have a query about my October or November 2020 invoice, who should I contact?

If you have any queries about your invoice, contact the finance department by emailing <invoicing@ukcloud.com>.

### How can I get access to the new G-Cloud 12 Service Definitions and Pricing Guides?

# Onboarding responsibilities for UKCloud services

## Overview

When a UKCloud service is initially provisioned (a process sometimes referred to as onboarding), responsibilities are divided between UKCloud and the customer.

This article indicates which activities are the responsibility of UKCloud and which are the responsibility of the customer.

## Responsibilities

The following table outlines the boundaries of responsibilities for UKCloud services.

<u>Key</u>

- **R = Responsible** - The person who performs an activity or does the work

- **A = Accountable** - The person who is ultimately accountable and has Yes/No/Veto

- **C = Consulted** - A person who needs to feedback and contribute to the activity

- **I = Informed** - A person who needs to know of the decision or action

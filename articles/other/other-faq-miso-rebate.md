# MISO rebate FAQs

## General

### What is the MISO rebate?

Crown Commercial Service (CCS) operates a management charge of between 0.75% and 1.15% for every service sold through the G-Cloud framework agreements. This charge is calculated from monthly reports submitted by G-Cloud suppliers to the CCS Management Information System Online (MISO).

We'll rebate 0.5% of the charge that partners incur as a result of selling our services via G-Cloud.

### What is included and excluded?

We'll rebate any MISO charges incurred directly due to selling UKCloud services.

We won't rebate any MISO charges incurred for any services over and above the UKCloud element of the service, for example managed service wraps charged as part of the overall solution.

### When did the MISO rebate go live?

You can make claims for relevant MISO charges incurred since 1 August 2016.

### When can I claim?

There are two windows per year when you can submit a claim: March and September. However, if any claim reaches more than £500, we'll consider an earlier submission.

### How do I apply for the MISO rebate?

Send UKCloud evidence of the charges you have incurred by selling our services through G-Cloud. We have created a [form](https://cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com/Docs/Documents/UKC-FRM-159%20UKCloud%20Partner%20Miso%20Claim.xlsx?AWSAccessKeyId=438-1048-5-aefff7-1&Expires=1667646130&Signature=b1Dzbkk%2Blqe9Ue%2FQDkFeQVHzgg4%3D) for you to use which is available on the portal.

Please note, this is solely for an element of the overall MISO charge. We're not under any obligation to offer any rebate where the claim is not substantiated by sufficient evidence.

### How will the rebate be applied?

We'll apply the rebate by crediting your next monthly invoice by the amount you have applied for.

### What happens if CCS increases the G-Cloud management charges?

The MISO rebate that we offer to our partners will be limited to 0.5%, irrespective of the MISO charge levied by CCS to its suppliers.

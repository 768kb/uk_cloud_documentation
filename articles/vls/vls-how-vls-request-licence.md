# How to request a new VLS licence

## Overview

VMware licence keys are associated with a specific version of the product. When you upgrade to a different version (not including patches), you need a new licence key. If you're planning to upgrade any VLS-licensed VMware products, you must request a new upgraded licence to cover the new version before performing the upgrade.

> [!NOTE]
> If you upgrade prior to requesting a new licence, depending on the product, you may be covered by the product's trial grace period, during which time you must request the new licence.

## Requesting a new VLS licence

To request an upgrade to an existing licence, raise a Service Request, stating the following:

- Product and version you're upgrading from

- Product and version you're upgrading to

- First and last 5-character blocks of your current VLS licence key

- Date of your planned upgrade

For more information about raising Service Requests, see [*How to use My Calls to raise and monitor support tickets*](../portal/ptl-how-use-my-calls.md).

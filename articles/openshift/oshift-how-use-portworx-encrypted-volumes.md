# How to use Portworx encrypted volumes

## Overview

Portworx is a cloud-native storage solution that is now available as an integration with our OpenShift offering. This article describes how you can enable encryption for Portworx volumes.

### Intended audience

This article assumes you have access to a Portworx integrated OpenShift 3.11 cluster (or later) and that you have cluster-admin rights. It also assumes familiarity with `oc`, the OpenShift command-line client.

If you're interested in a free 30 day trial of Portworx, raise a Service Request via the [My Calls](https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/ivanti) section of the UKCloud Portal.

## Encryption Scope

Portworx uses passphrase encryption to protect volume data, both at rest and in transit, using an AES-256 cipher. Passphrases are stored as OpenShift secrets and you can set them either cluster-wide or per volume. In this article, we'll refer to passphrases as keys.

### Cluster-wide

Where a persistent volume claim (pvc) is created against a storage class that has the parameter `secure: "true"` set in its spec, the volume is encrypted using a cluster-wide key. Below is an example of a storage class spec that enables volume encryption:

```none
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
    name: portworx-repl1-encrypted
provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
parameters:
   secure: "true"
   repl: "1"
```

You can set the cluster-wide key by using the following command to create a secret:

```none
$ oc create secret generic px-vol-encryption --from-literal=cluster-wide-secret-key='<desired-key>' -n portworx
```

You need to pass the name of the key within the `px-vol-encryption` secret to Portworx, which you can do with the below commands:

```none
$ PX_POD=$(oc get pods -l name=portworx -n kube-system -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

$ oc exec $PX_POD -n kube-system -c portworx -- /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets set-cluster-key --secret cluster-wide-secret-key
```

Now that you've set the cluster key, any pvc created using a secure storage class will be encrypted with the key. Below is an example of a pvc spec referencing the encrypted storage class created earlier:

```none
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pvc-with-cluster-key
spec:
  storageClassName: portworx-repl1-encrypted
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```

Alternatively you can set a pvc to use the cluster key when using a non-secure storage class by adding the following annotation to the pvc spec:

```none
metadata:
  annotations:
    px/secure: "true"
```

### Per volume

As an alternative to using a cluster-wide key, you can use a secret per persistent volume claim (pvc). You should store the desired key within a secret in the Portworx project and reference it in the pvc spec using the following annotations:

```none
metadata:
  annotations:
    px/secret-name: volume-secrets-name
    px/secret-namespace: portworx
    px/secret-key: specific-pvc-key
```

`px/secret-name` refers to the secret object, `px/secret-namespace` should be `portworx` as the Portworx pods have privileges to read secrets in this project and `px/secret-key` refers to the specific key within the `px/secret-name` secret.

Below is an example spec for a pvc that is encrypted using an individual secret:

```none
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pvc-with-individual-key
  annotations:
    px/secret-name: volume-secrets
    px/secret-namespace: portworx
    px/secret-key: pvc-with-individual-key
spec:
  storageClassName: portworx-repl1
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```

# How to view proxy logs in your multinetwork OpenShift cluster

## Overview

UKCloud for OpenShift enables you to develop, deploy, and manage digital and container-based applications seamlessly across local physical or virtual environments, with full portability to and from UKCloud.

This article explains how you can view the connection logs generated by the squid proxy in your OpenShift cluster.

### Prerequisites

Your OpenShift cluster must have access to multiple networks, be version 3.11 or later, and must have proxy logging enabled. Any OpenShift clusters deployed from November 2019 will have proxy logging enabled. If you have an older OpenShift cluster and would like proxy logging enabled then raise a request on the UKCloud Portal requesting this functionality.

## Viewing logs

In multinetwork 3.11 clusters we run a squid proxy on the controlplane loadbalancers in order to authenticate to Red Hats container registry 'registry.redhat.io'. This also allows you to hit internet endpoints from community network nodes providing you pass the correct variables to your pods and have whitelisted the endpoint. You may inadvertently be traversing the proxy where you do not want to or attempting to hit endpoints that are not whitelisted which will cause you to get 403 forbidden errors. 

As a customer you have no access to the controlplane loadbalancers so we now send the logs through to a set of fluentd pods in a project called squid-showback, they are then forwarded on to the clusters Aggregated Logging and can be viewed in the Kibana dashboard in the openshift-logging project.

Set a filter of kubernetes_namespace_name: "squid-showback" to filter only for the logs from the pods receiving the proxy logs and show only the message. You can then query the message field for the particular IP/endpoint you're looking for. From here you can see if it's being denied and update the whitelist as needed.

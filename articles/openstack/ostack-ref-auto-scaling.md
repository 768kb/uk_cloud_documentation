# Auto Scaling for UKCloud for OpenStack

By using pre-defined rules that consider factors such as CPU or memory usage, you can configure Orchestration (HEAT) to automatically add and remove additional instances as needed.

For information about how to automatically scale out your compute instances in response to heavy system usage, see [*Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 Auto Scaling for Compute*](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/auto_scaling_for_instances/index).

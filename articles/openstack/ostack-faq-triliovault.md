# Self Service Backup & Restoration (TrilioVault) FAQs

## General 

This article explains what is and isn't included in the scope of the ProtectionOpenStack Self Service Backup & Restorations (TrilioVault) service option.

TrilioVault is one of a variety of on-platform protection options available from UKCloud. Use this article to understand instance backup and restoration and whether it will meet your own recovery point (RPO) or recovery time (RTO) objectives.

## About Self Service Backup & Restoration (TrilioVault)

When you opt a OpenStack Instance into the TrilioVault service, the Instance is added to your TrilioVault self-service dashboard within OpenStack. Backups made of the entire Instance running on your UKCloud for OpenStack service.

Data protected by this service has a variable RPO dictated by the frequency of backups scheduled by the end user. RTO is determined by the time taken to restore the backup once you have instantiated it via the OpenStack dashboard.

## Backup & Restoration management

You can make changes to your Backup and Restoration service directly via the OpenStack Dashboard. You can:
 - Opt Instances into the service 
 - Change the backup policy for an Instance
 - Opt Instances out of the backup service
 - Instantiate the restoration of an entire Instances from an existing backup
 - Instantiate the restoration of an individual file from an existing backup

## Restores

As a fully self-service function, customers can invoke their own restorations of either an entire instance or individual files via the OpenStack Dashboard.## How is Self Service Backup & Restoration (TrilioVault) charged?

TrilioVault is chargeable based on the number of Instances protected and the capacity utilised to store the data.

No protection products are automatically applied to Instances running on the UKCloud platform, therefore you must explicitly select the protection option that best meets your requirements.

## Frequency and timing

As TrilioVault is fully self-service, customers have full control as to the time and frequency that any backups occur.

## Alerting and reporting

Information about your backups is reported via the OpenStack dashboard, where the status of all backup and restoration events can be monitored in real time.

## Success rate

We do not guarantee successful backups, but we provide customers with full visibility as to the status of any backups along with the ability for customers to re-instantiate any backups that fail to complete.

## Rerun of failed backups

The onus is upon the customer to monitor the success of their backups via the tools made available within OpenStack. UKCloud will not automatically invoke any reruns of failed backups .

## What SLA do you offer on snapshot success?

TrilioVault backups don't include an SLA. You should be aware that backups may occasionally fail for a variety of reasons. The status of TrilioVault backups should be monitored by the customer via the OpenStack dashboard.

This service is not backed by service credits.

The UKCloud support team can help provide customers with the support around investigating any failures upon the customer requesting assistance.

## Planned maintenance

On occasion, planned maintenance of the OpenStack platform will take precedence over this service. If there's a potential disruption, we'll highlight this to you via the service status page and UKCloud Portal notifications system.

## Additional data protection services

UKCloud for OpenStack also offers self-service snapshot protection natively from within the platform should you not require the advanced features of TrilioVault.

If none of these services meet your requirements, you can also implement and manage your own protection solution.

The UKCloud Cloud Storage platform may be an appropriate target for self-managed solutions using software such as CommVault and NetWorker.

# UKCloud enablement services

As a multi-cloud provider, UKCloud knows the importance of being able to install your own hardware in our cloud platform. We call this *Cloud Enablement* because it's a key capability that enables you to use cloud services more extensively. Some examples include providing secure facilities for:

- Your own hosting servers and storage hardware

- Your own VPN hardware

- Your Hardware Security Module (HSM) to provide secure key management and encryption capabilities across your workloads

For more information, see the [*Cloud Enablement Service Scope*](enbl-sco-hosting.md).

> [!NOTE]
> ANY device placed within the UKCloud estate must be done so to utilise our cloud services. If you do not plan to use a UKCloud service as part of your design (such as UKCloud for VMware or Cloud Storage), we can arrange for you to talk to one of our partners about your co-location requirements.

The following diagram shows the different configurations available to you for these Cloud Enablement services:

Other enablement services that we provide to help you work with our cloud platform include:

- Mass Data Transfer - Enables you to move virtualised environments, in the form of VMs, into or out of your UKCloud environment using your own NAS, HDD, or USB devices. For more information, see the [*Mass Transfer Facility Service Scope*](enbl-sco-mtf-nas.md).

- Data Transfer - Region to Region - Enables you to move your UKCloud for VMware workloads between regions on the UKCloud platform. For more information, see the [*Data Transfer - Region to Region Service Scope*](enbl-sco-transfer-regions.md).

- Data Transfer between Assured and Elevated - Enables you to move your workloads between the Assured and Elevated security domains to better meet sensitivity requirements. For more information, see the [*Data Transfer between Assured and Elevated Service Scope*](enbl-sco-transfer-assured-elevated.md).

- Smart Hands - This service can be used for a number of different requirements such as a physical 'push-button' task, replacing hardware and checking equipment statuses. For more information, see the [*Smart Hands Service Scope*](enbl-sco-smart-hands.md).

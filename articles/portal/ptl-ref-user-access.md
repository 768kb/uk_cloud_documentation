# Portal user access

For all customers in the UKCloud Portal there is a concept of companies, business accounts and services, which allows for different levels of segregation.

When a customer starts using the UKCloud Portal, we create the initial administrator username that enables access prior to any customer data or systems being provisioned on our platforms.

Security of our services is paramount and we provide the facilities to enable customers to manage user access; this is also because we have no means of verifying the identity, roles and access rights of an individual user.

## Administrator responsibilities

Customers need to allocate administrators who are responsible for:

- Adding and deleting new user accounts

- Maintaining the appropriate permissions and access for users

- Activating and locking individual user accounts where required

- Resetting passwords

- Ensuring that only appropriate users are listed as administrators

To avoid a situation where all administrators are unable to access services, UKCloud recommends that each customer assigns multiple administrators.

## UKCloud Support

There are a number of Access Management activities which UKCloud can assist with. These are:

- **Enabling access to multiple business accounts for individual users.** This can be provided through a Service Request raised by a user from the business account for which access will be enabled.

- **VPN set up on a secondary edge gateway.** Customers are able to configure and manage an edge gateway VPN on their primary edge gateway; however where a secondary edge gateway is used, UKCloud will assist in establishing the VPN and administering VPN accounts and passwords. Customers can also choose to install and self-manage an alternative VPN product.

- **Password reset and account unlock for an administrator.** In this scenario the administrator will need to provide details from their memorable word. UKCloud Support will send credentials to the telephone number registered to the administrator's user account.

- **Provide a listing of user account permissions.** We recognise that customers may want to undertake an audit of the permissions of Portal users. Permissions for each user are visible under **Contacts** and we can also provide an extract of these.

### Password reset

In the event that you need to reset your password:

- For the Assured OFFICIAL Portal, a self-service facility is available from the log on page. Alternatively your administrator can change your password.

- For the Elevated OFFICIAL Portal, your password or memorable word will need to be changed by your administrator.

UKCloud Support will advise you of the names of your administrators if required.

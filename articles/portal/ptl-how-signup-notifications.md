# How to sign up for Portal notifications

## Overview

When you use the UKCloud Portal, you'll notice that notifications are provided at the top of every page. These notifications provide information about incidents that have occurred on the UKCloud platform.

If you want, you can also opt to have these notifications sent to you by email. This feature is available in both the Assured and Elevated Portals.

To keep up to date with everything that's happening on the UKCloud platform, including general service availability, scheduled maintenance and incidents, go to the [UKCloud Service Status page](https://status.ukcloud.com/). For more information, see [*Understanding the UKCloud Service Status page*](../other/other-ref-status-page.md).

## Opting in to Portal notifications by email

1. [*Log in to the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md#logging-in-to-the-ukcloud-portal).

2. In the top-right of the toolbar, click your username and select **Update contact details**.

4. You should now receive Portal notification emails to the email address associated with your Portal account.

> [!NOTE]
> This may not happen immediately as the update will need to sync with Active Directory. If you experience any issues with receiving emails from the Portal, raise a ticket with UKCloud Support.

# How to switch to a different account in the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

Each Portal user account is associated with one or more customer accounts. Within the Portal, you can work within any customer account to which you have access.

### Intended audience

To switch between accounts, your user account must have access to multiple customer accounts.

## Switching accounts

To switch to a different account:

1. [*Log in to the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md#logging-in-to-the-ukcloud-portal).

2. The Portal toolbar indicates the current customer account that you are working in.

3. Click the account name and select the account that you want to switch to.

# How to change your email address in the UKCloud Portal

## Overview

If you need to change the email address you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal, you'll need to raise a Service Request to ensure that the correct permissions are associated with the new email address and single sign-on continues to work correctly.

However, if you only need to change the email address that's used to reset your password if you forget it, you can do that in the Portal.

## Changing your login email address

1. [*Log in to the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md#logging-in-to-the-ukcloud-portal) using your old email address.

2. [*Use My Calls to raise a Service Request*](ptl-how-use-my-calls.md).

    > [!TIP]
    > Use the **Generic Service Request** template.

3. Enter the details as required, including:

    - Your new email address

    - The name of the user account (if you have multiple accounts for the same email address)

4. A member of UKCloud Support will pick up the ticket and make the necessary changes.

5. When the change has been completed, a member of UKCloud Support will contact you, on the email address you used to raise the ticket, to verify that the change was successful.

6. Log in to the Portal using your new email address and verify that you can access My Calls.

7. Confirm with UKCloud Support that the update has been successful.

8. If you encounter any problems, contact UKCloud Support. If you can't access My Calls, you can call UKCloud Support on 01252 303 300 (select option 2).

## Changing your password reset email address

1. [*Log in to the UKCloud Portal*](ptl-gs.md#logging-in-to-the-ukcloud-portal) using your login email address.

2. Click your username in the toolbar and select **Update contact details**.

3. In the **Password Reset Email Address** field, enter the new email address, then click **Save**.

4. An email will be sent to both the old and new addresses providing information about the change.

5. If you encounter any problems, contact UKCloud Support.

In My Calls, on the **My Tickets** tab, find the ticket you want to view by:

- Browsing through the list of tickets. By default, tickets are listed with the newest first.

- Using the search field to find your ticket.

- Using filter options to find tickets with a particular status or date. You can also filter by incident and request ticket types.

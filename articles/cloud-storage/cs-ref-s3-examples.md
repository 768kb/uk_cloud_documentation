# S3-compatible API examples for Cloud Storage

UKCloud provides a project in our GitHub repository that contains sample code for common operations against UKCloud's ECS-based Cloud Storage service. While ECS itself supports both an S3 compatible and an EMC native API, the samples in this repository are designed to work with the S3-compatible endpoint only.

These examples show common operations in different languages, including Ruby and Python.

You can find the examples in our GitHub repository here: <https://github.com/UKCloud/ecs-s3-examples>

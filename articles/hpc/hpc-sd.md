# High Performance Compute Service Definition

> [!IMPORTANT]
> High Performance Compute has been retired from sale by UKCloud. We will continue to support all existing customers who are using this service, however, we are no longer providing this service for new workloads. This article provides existing High Performance Compute customers with access to support documentation and we will continue to update it as required. For new requests, contact your Account Manager or Service Delivery Manager.

## What is High Performance Compute?

High Performance Compute (HPC) is designed to give you the compute power to help you solve large scale problems. Whether you need rapid real time data processing to provide direction to teams making life or death decisions, the ability to process complex large data sets in search of patterns to unlock new knowledge or to be able to simulate hypotheses to support fast innovation in healthcare or science, HPC can help by providing an easy to deploy and easy to use compute infrastructure that can power Grid engine or parallel processing workloads that typically underpin these services.

## What the service can help you achieve

- **Provides agility.** Prove and validate hypotheses in days, not years, with the ability to adjust, and then run again quickly and efficiently.

- **Reduces risk.** Avoid hardware lock-in, providing flexibility if the hypothesis changes.

- **Facilitates collaboration.** Encourage community collaboration on solving problems by enabling your platform to talk across multiple community networks.

- **A singular focus.** Work with all levels of data classification – without having to build appropriate security and compliance regimes yourself – ensuring more time is spent asking questions and solving problems.

- **A platform to support you.** Flexible and reconfigurable deployment patterns to evolve the platform as you understand more about the problem you are solving.

## Product options

The service is designed to be flexible and enables you to mix and match from a range of pre-defined options for each workload and change them when required.

## Pricing and packaging

High Performance Compute pricing can be as low as 5p per hour. Full pricing with all options is available in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## Accreditation and information assurance

The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the [UKCloud website](https://ukcloud.com/governance/).

## Connectivity options

UKCloud provides one of the best-connected cloud platforms for the UK Public Sector. We enable access to our secure platform by DDoS-protected internet, PSN, Janet, HSCN, RLI and your own leased lines via our HybridConnect or CrownConnect services. The full range of flexible connectivity options is detailed in the [UKCloud Pricing Guide](https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide).

## An SLA you can trust

We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud. For full details on the service SLA, including measurements and service credits, see the [*SLA definition*](../other/other-ref-sla-definition.md).

## The small print

High Performance Compute operates a minimum commitment of 24 months. Early exit charges apply if you exit this service whilst still within the minimum commitment term. If you exit the service within the minimum commit then UKCloud will bill the remaining cost of the Committed Compute Spend within the final invoice.

For full terms and conditions, including onboarding and responsibilities, refer to the [*Terms and conditions documents*](../other/other-ref-terms-and-conditions.md).

## Why UKCloud?

UKCloud is dedicated to the digital transformation of our nation's public services through our flexible, secure and cost-effective multi-cloud platform and the expertise of our people and partners. We believe that diversity of technology drives value and innovation and so we bring together different cloud technologies, with different deployment models spanning on-premises (private cloud), on-campus (Government's Crown Campus) and off-campus global public cloud services. This enables you to choose the right cloud for creating new workloads or migrating or replacing existing applications to the cloud with specialist SaaS solutions.

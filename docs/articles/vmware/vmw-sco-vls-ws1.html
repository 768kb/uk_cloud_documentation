<h2 id="about-this-document">About this document</h2>
<p>This article describes the boundaries of the UKCloud VMware Workspace ONE VMware License Service (VLS), along with the division of responsibilities between VMware, UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service.</p>
<h2 id="about-ukcloud-vmware-workspace-one-vls">About UKCloud VMware Workspace ONE VLS</h2>
<h3 id="about-vls">About VLS</h3>
<p>VLS is an innovative licensing model, designed with VMware, to reduce cost and deliver licence flexibility for a customer's existing VMware estate. This flexibility makes it easier to modernise existing VMware environments as the customer's organisation transforms IT services or adopts a multi-cloud approach.</p>
<p>Whether purchasing new licences or providing support and maintenance on an existing VMware estate, VLS enables customers to exchange fixed upfront costs and long-term commitments with a VMware consumption-based licence provided via UKCloud. With this new operation model, the functionality of the VMware licences is identical, only the commercial, cost and commitment term is changed.</p>
<h3 id="about-vmware-workspace-one">About VMware Workspace ONE</h3>
<p>VMware Workspace ONE® is an intelligence-driven digital workspace platform that simply and securely delivers and manages any application on any device by integrating access control, application management and multi-platform endpoint management. Workspace ONE is built on the VMware Workspace ONE Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) technology and integrates with virtual application delivery on a common identity framework. With Workspace ONE organisations can now evolve silo-ed cloud and mobile investments, enabling all employees, devices and things across the organisation to accelerate their digital transformation journey with a platform-based approach.</p>
<p>Workspace ONE enables customers to drastically improve experiences and tasks that were previously costly, time consuming and resource intensive. With Workspace ONE, IT organisations can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Onboard a new employee with all of their applications and devices in under an hour, without tickets and help desk calls</p>
</li>
<li><p>Set and enforce access and data policies across all applications, devices and locations in ONE place</p>
</li>
<li><p>Complete business processes from a mobile device, similar to consumer experiences</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provision a new corporate laptop out of the box, anywhere in the world, from the cloud within minutes</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get insights and automation capabilities across the entire digital workspace environment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-architecture">Service architecture</h2>
<p>The UKCloud service architecture is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Company.</strong> A contract with UKCloud is associated with a company, which provides a single owner for the contract, regardless of how many accounts are created.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Account.</strong> We use accounts to separate financial ownership. An account could represent an organisation, a customer contract or a specific project. An account can also have several UKCloud or VMware services associated with it, such as VMware Workspace ONE, UKCloud for VMware, Cloud Storage and VLS. Customers can also use accounts to separate users based on access requirements or permissions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vmware-workspace-one-edition-provided-by-ukcloud">VMware Workspace ONE edition provided by UKCloud</h2>
<p>VMware Workspace ONE is the simple and secure enterprise platform that delivers and manages any application on any smartphone, tablet or laptop. The UKCloud service is based on the Workspace ONE Standard Edition. Customers requiring other editions or add-on features should contact UKCloud for further discussion.</p>
<p>The VMware Workspace ONE Editions comparison table is available <a href="https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/workspace-one/vmw-workspace-one-edition-comparison-guide.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="application-process">Application process</h2>
<p>Customers wanting to discuss the suitability of the service and gain a comparative cost estimate for their VMware Workspace ONE environment under the VLS programme should contact us at <a href="mailto:info@ukcloud.com">info@ukcloud.com</a> or contact their Client Director. To provide an indicative quote, we will need:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The customer's written authorisation to request data from VMware on the existing licence estate and renewal details</p>
</li>
<li><p>The customer's VMware Entitlement Account (EA) number</p>
</li>
<li><p>Details of the customer's planned future use of VMware to ensure the correct bundles/features are provisioned in any VLS proposal</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will then work with the customer to find the ideal solution to suit their requirements. This will include discussing monthly or annual upfront payments, which include additional discounts.</p>
<p>Once the quote is supplied and the customer wants to place an order, they must provide a purchase order, with a call-off contract if transacted within the G-Cloud framework, where we have a specific VLS service listed. Once received, the order will be confirmed by our sales operations team.</p>
<h2 id="service-provisioning">Service provisioning</h2>
<p>After UKCloud receives a purchase order for VMware Workspace ONE, we'll contact the customer to advise them when the environment will be available. Within 1 business day of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised on request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and any relevant documentation.</p>
<p>The VMware Workspace UEM environment will be configured and available within 72 hours of receiving the order; shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised on request.</p>
<p>UKCloud has created several videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the Knowledge Centre.</p>
<p>UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud can introduce customers to the right partner to suit their needs.</p>
<h2 id="end-user-device-and-application-licensing-responsibilities">End user device and application licensing responsibilities</h2>
<p>Each end user device requires a Workspace ONE licence. Each application hosted within the environment will have an appropriate licensing agreement that is required as well. The customer is responsible for all end user device and application software licensing.</p>
<h2 id="platform-management">Platform management</h2>
<p>Customers can access, manage and view the VMware Workspace ONE platform, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Workspace ONE UEM portal.</strong> Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to access the customer's Workspace ONE environment (depending on assigned permissions).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Workspace ONE API.</strong> Enables the programmatic creation and management of the services inside the platform.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>UKCloud Portal.</strong> Provides access to incident and request management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware.</p>
<h2 id="ukcloud-and-vmware-workspace-one-service-and-maintenance-status">UKCloud and VMware Workspace ONE service and maintenance status</h2>
<p>Customers are advised to subscribe to notifications for information on services provided by UKCloud and VMware using the links below:</p>

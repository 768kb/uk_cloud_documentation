<h2 id="service-implementation">Service implementation</h2>
<p>UKCloud for Managed OpenShift is built using Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) v4, which is the enterprise-hardened version of OKD (previously Origins) v4, which extends the open source Kubernetes project.</p>
<p>UKCloud for Managed OpenShift is built as an isolated single-tenant environment on top of UKCloud's secure, assured multi-tenant UKCloud for OpenStack IaaS service, helping to deliver the benefits of single-tenant isolation with the economics and flexibility of multi-tenant infrastructure.</p>
<p>UKCloud for Managed OpenShift is available in our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains on our Tier 1 platform. UKCloud for Managed OpenShift is available on our Tier 2 platform for workloads that require greater levels of security.</p>
<h3 id="deployment-options">Deployment options</h3>
<p>UKCloud for Managed OpenShift is packaged to provide you with a high level of flexibility to scale your environments inline with your workloads.</p>
<p>With UKCloud for Managed OpenShift, we deploy an OpenShift cluster that contains multiple nodes: master nodes for the control plane, infrastructure nodes for additional services, such as ingress controllers, metrics, developer console and aggregated logging, and application nodes for your containerised applications.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>An operational OpenShift cluster requires a minimum of three master nodes to provide the control plane and we recommend a minimum of two infrastructure nodes to provide additional services, such as ingress controllers, metrics, developer console and aggregated logging. You'll need at least one application node to run your application and we recommend a minimum of two nodes for resilience.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="master-nodes">Master nodes</h4>
<p>Master nodes provide the foundation OpenShift services to support the orchestration and management of the container runtime environments. An operational OpenShift cluster requires a minimum of three master nodes for API, scheduling and etcd key-value store.</p>
<h4 id="infrastructure-nodes">Infrastructure nodes</h4>
<p>Infrastructure nodes provide supporting services such as OpenShift routers, registry, metric collection and aggregated logging. Infrastructure nodes are not mandatory, but we recommend a minimum of two infrastructure nodes to provide integrated cluster services.</p>
<h4 id="application-nodes">Application nodes</h4>
<p>Application nodes provide the compute resources to host your containerised applications and services. We strongly recommend the initial deployment of two or more application nodes for production environments to provide resilience to your workloads in the event of the failure of a single node.</p>
<h3 id="storage-options">Storage options</h3>
<p>Containers in OpenShift by default don't persist data. Every time an application is started, it creates a new container with an immutable image. Hence, any persisted data in the file systems is lost when the container stops or is destroyed. Use persistent volumes within your OpenShift environment to provide data persistence independent of containers. You can purchase persistent volumes for your cluster as stated below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> </th>
<th>Tier 1 Persistent Volume</th>
<th>Tier 2 Persistent Volume</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Overview</strong></td>
<td>Provides our most performant block storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput</td>
<td>Block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Number of file copies</strong></td>
<td>3</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Use cases</strong></td>
<td>Web caching<br>Containerised analytics<br>Highly performant, real-time web/mobile applications</td>
<td>Standard, containerised web/mobile applications<br>Storing OpenShift logs and metrics</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In line with current restrictions on the OpenStack service underpinning OpenShift, you can make/attach 25 additional persistent volume claims (PVCs) to each worker node.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="optional-extras">Optional extras</h3>
<p>To complement your UKCloud for Managed OpenShift service, UKCloud offers the following value-added options.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Some of these extras will carry supplementary charges; please see the <a href="https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide">UKCloud Pricing Guide</a> for full details.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="additional-networks">Additional networks</h4>
<p>By default, your OpenShift cluster will only be connected to the internet. Your OpenShift environment can be provisioned on other networks such as PSN, HSCN, Janet and RLI at a flat fee per month per network plus the additional network charges. For more information, see the <a href="https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide">UKCloud Pricing Guide</a>.</p>
<h4 id="registry-storage">Registry storage</h4>
<p>A benefit of OpenShift is its ability to build Docker images directly from your source code, deploy them, and manage their lifecycle. To enable this, OpenShift utilises an integrated Docker registry to locally manage images. This registry is stored securely, using our Cloud Storage service, outside of your OpenShift environment to help ensure the resilience and availability of your images. Standard Cloud Storage rates apply, for more information, see the <a href="https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide">UKCloud Pricing Guide</a>.</p>
<h4 id="enhanced-aggregated-logging">Enhanced aggregated logging</h4>
<p>By default, an EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) stack is deployed onto infrastructure nodes to aggregate logs for a range of OpenShift Enterprise services. Application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access. The EFK stack aggregates logs from hosts and applications, whether coming from multiple containers or even deleted pods.</p>
<p>To provide this service, UKCloud will need to provision an initial allocation of Tier 2 persistent volume, charged at the prevailing rate, for the storage of logs.</p>
<p>As your workloads increase or become more critical and you want to increase the performance and resilience of your Elasticsearch cluster by scaling it across three nodes, you can deploy an additional infrastructure node.</p>
<h4 id="enhanced-metric-collection">Enhanced metric collection</h4>
<p>UKCloud will provision a Prometheus-based metrics platform to collect and publish your cluster's metrics from all containers and components in one user interface. This will run on infrastructure nodes, if you have them, or application nodes otherwise.</p>
<p>To provide this service, UKCloud will need to provision an initial allocation of Tier 2 persistent volume, charged at the prevailing rate, to store this data.</p>
<p>To provide resilience and added performance to your cluster's metrics, you can deploy additional infrastructure nodes.</p>
<h4 id="ssl-certificates">SSL certificates</h4>
<p>By default, UKCloud will provide 90-day Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for your OpenShift cluster. At the point of deployment, you can provide your own certificates for use with OpenShift.</p>
<h4 id="container-native-storage">Container native storage</h4>
<p>To facilitate the deployment of stateful workloads, UKCloud for Managed OpenShift offers dynamically provisioned persistent storage. It is vital that any persistent workloads utilise the appropriate storage policy for the workload to ensure no data loss when a container restarts. The customer is responsible for backup and disaster recovery of any data stored in persistent volumes.</p>
<h3 id="backuprecovery-and-disaster-recovery">Backup/recovery and disaster recovery</h3>
<p>As standard, localised component failures are tolerated within the infrastructure through elimination of single points of failure (including physical server failure or disk failure).</p>
<p>Although OpenShift is designed to deploy and manage stateless applications (applications that can be destroyed and re-instantiated without risk of data loss), you should maintain a master copy or backup copy of any persistent or dynamic data hosted on this service (such as MySQL DB) by using, for example, UKCloud's <a href="../cloud-storage/cs-sd.html">Cloud Storage</a> service.</p>
<h3 id="service-limitations">Service limitations</h3>
<h4 id="scalability">Scalability</h4>
<p>As a true cloud platform, UKCloud for Managed OpenShift provides full elasticity and scalability. However, to protect the integrity of the platform and manage customer spend, soft limits on the number and size of application instances will be in place. These limits may be extended on request.</p>
<h4 id="persistent-volumes">Persistent volumes</h4>
<p>In line with current restrictions on the OpenStack service that underpins OpenShift, you can claim/attach 25 additional persistent volume claims (PVCs) to each worker node.</p>
<h3 id="published-features-not-currently-available">Published features not currently available</h3>
<p>The following features published in the <a href="oshift-sd.html">UKCloud for Managed OpenShift Service Definition</a> are not currently available:</p>
<ul>

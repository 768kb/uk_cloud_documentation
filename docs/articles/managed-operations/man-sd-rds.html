<h2 id="what-is-managed-remote-desktop-services-support">What is Managed Remote Desktop Services Support?</h2>
<p>Our Managed Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Support service aims to remove the day-to-day burden of having to ensure your Remote Desktop Services and supporting Windows servers are stable, secure, and available.</p>
<p>RDS enables users to take control of a remote computer or virtual machine over a network connection. RDS is Microsoft's implementation of thin client architecture, where Windows software, and the entire desktop of the computer running RDS, are made accessible to any remote client machine that supports Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). User interfaces are displayed from the server onto the client system and input from the client system is transmitted to the server – where software execution takes place.</p>
<p>Organisations often struggle to find or fund the resources required to ensure the ongoing health and availability of their RDS environment. With UKCloud's Managed RDS Support service, we provide you with full 24x7x365 monitoring and support for your Remote Desktop Services and supporting Windows servers across your multi-cloud estate, be it on-premises, on our cloud, or on a cloud deployment elsewhere. This level of monitoring and support, when coupled with pro-active Windows patching, provides you with the confidence that your RDS services are operating effectively, enabling you to focus on your business outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-service-can-help-you-achieve">What the service can help you achieve</h2>

<li><p><strong>Understand your costs</strong> – Our costs are fixed so you don't have to worry about deciphering and understanding SFIA day rates</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Remove your pain</strong> – Move towards consuming RDS as a commodity service</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pricing-and-packaging">Pricing and packaging</h2>
<p>Managed RDS Support pricing can be as low as £494 per month. Full pricing with all options is available in the <a href="https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide">UKCloud Pricing Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="accreditation-and-information-assurance">Accreditation and information assurance</h2>
<p>The security of our platform is our number one priority. We've always been committed to adhering to exacting standards, frameworks and best practice. Everything we do is subject to regular independent validation by government accreditors, sector auditors and management system assessors. Details are available on the <a href="https://ukcloud.com/governance/">UKCloud website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="connectivity-options">Connectivity options</h2>
<p>UKCloud provides one of the best-connected cloud platforms for the UK Public Sector. We enable access to our secure platform by DDoS-protected internet, PSN, Janet, HSCN, RLI and your own leased lines via our HybridConnect or CrownConnect services. The full range of flexible connectivity options is detailed in the <a href="https://ukcloud.com/pricing-guide">UKCloud Pricing Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="an-sla-you-can-trust">An SLA you can trust</h2>
<p>We understand that enterprise workloads need a dependable service that underpins the reliability of the application to users and other systems, which is why we offer one of the best SLAs on G-Cloud. As the SLA varies based on the chosen cloud technology, you can find full details on each service's SLA, including measurements and service credits, in the <a href="../other/other-ref-sla-definition.html"><em>SLA definition</em></a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-small-print">The small print</h2>
<p>A minimum term of twelve months applies to the Account Management fee and any associated (RDS and Windows Server) Support fees. Any additional RDS environments or Windows Servers will automatically initiate a new 12-month Account Management term and 12-month term for the new additional RDS environments or Windows Servers. That is, the Account Management fee shall always run in parallel with the most current Support Fee term. Should early termination be invoked, the customer shall be liable for the remaining balance of the term (both Account Management and Support Fee). For example, if a customer's spend is £1,000 per month and they terminate at month nine, they are liable for the remaining three months/£3,000 in full and shall pay within 30 days of invoice.</p>
<p>For full terms and conditions including onboarding and responsibilities, refer to the <a href="../other/other-ref-terms-and-conditions.html"><em>Terms and conditions documents</em></a>.</p>

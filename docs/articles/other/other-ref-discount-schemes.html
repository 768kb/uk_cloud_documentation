<h1 id="ukcloud-discount-and-purchase-schemes">UKCloud discount and purchase schemes</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>UKCloud provides several discount and purchase schemes, including commitment and annual subscription discounts and our Cloud Credits purchasing scheme.</p>
<h2 id="commitment-discount">Commitment discount</h2>
<p>Customers commit to spending a specific minimum amount each month for a minimum of 12 months. The discount level attained is based on the total spend committed for the 12 months.</p>
<p>To achieve the discount, the customer will fix a value that they will commit to spend for each month of the term. This must be in a single purchase order (PO) with each month as a separate line item. As customers can consume more than their committed amount each month, they must also add an additional line item and value to cover any overspend. This must be part of the same PO.</p>
<p>If the customer has an existing contract, they need to accept a Contract Change Notice and set the values as outlined above. If multiple contracts are affected, any changes will be made via a Side Letter.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>PO value</th>
<th>Discount level</th>

<tbody>

<tr>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li><p>Individual projects or departments (billing entities associated with each monthly spend) can be amended during the year through discussion with, and agreement from, UKCloud; however, the committed value cannot be reduced midterm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customers get a discounted rate for each month, up to the set monthly figure only, not for overuse.</p>
</li>
<li><p>At the end of each month, UKCloud will do one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the actual usage is above the committed value, UKCloud will take the value from the monthly commitment line item and the remaining balance from the overspend line item.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the actual usage is below the set value, UKCloud will bill the customer the committed value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>At the end of the 12 months, UKCloud will rebate the value of the applicable discount over the 12-month period minus any overuse for the last month; so, the invoice for month 12 is for the committed consumption plus any overuse at standard prices, with the potential for a 12-month rebate.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the overspend PO line item value is spent before the end of the 12 months, the customer must issue a top-up PO value for the remainder of the 12 months, or increase their spend and commit to a further 12 months.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The customer will pay for any usage above the set amount at the standard rates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The discount is set based on the committed PO value, not the actual usage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="annual-subscription-discount">Annual subscription discount</h2>
<p>This discount scheme is aimed at customers who consistently utilise a number of virtual machines (VMs) that are running 24x7 throughout the year. Customers can gain a discount off the standard rates by subscribing to pay for VMs for a minimum 12-month period, and UKCloud will take the discount off the annualised hourly cost of the VM, which is payable in 12 equal monthly payments, regardless of actual usage.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Subscription period</th>
<th>Discount level</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>12 months</td>
<td>9%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Customers must specify the quantity of VMs (by VM size and service level) they want to subscribe to, and there is no minimum level. The UKCloud billing system will automatically offset the cost of VMs that exactly match the size and service level of the specified VMs. All other VMs and ancillary services (additional storage to subscribed VMs) will be billed at standard UKCloud rates.</p>
<h3 id="annual-subscription-discount-worked-example-ukcloud-for-vmware">Annual subscription discount worked example (UKCloud for VMware)</h3>
<p>If you know you'll consume a minimum of 20 Large ESSENTIAL VMs on the Assured OFFICIAL security domain for at least a year, you can make an annual subscription to those 20 VMs and receive an effective 9% discount.</p>
<p>A Large ESSENTIAL VM on Assured costs £0.18 per hour, therefore £1,576.80 per year (£0.18 x 24 hours per day x 354 days), so 20 of these VMs would usually cost £31,536 per year.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to these 20 VMs for a year, you'll get a 9% discount (£2,838.24), reducing the annual cost to £28,697.76, billed at £2,391.48 per month. In months where you use less that 20 VMs, you'll still be billed at £2,391.48. In months where you use more than 20 VMs, the additional VMs will be billed at standard UKCloud rates.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-credits">Cloud Credits</h2>
<p>You can purchase Cloud Credits upfront and redeem them against our cloud services over a maximum two-year period. This enables organisations to effectively commit their CAPEX or budget spend in advance, with monthly usage deducted from the balance until depleted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every £1 spent on Cloud Credits equals £1 to be spent on our cloud services.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The purchase of Cloud Credits can be made against any Service Definition and Cloud Credits are transferable between services.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cloud Credits can be used for a single service or a combination of services or orders.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any unused Cloud Credits at the end of the two-year period will be non-refundable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cloud-credits-worked-example">Cloud Credits worked example</h3>
<p>If, based on previous or projected usage, you know you'll consume at least £550,000 worth of cloud services over a two-year period, you may choose to pre-pay this amount. You'll receive £550,000 worth of Cloud Credits to be used against any UKCloud service over a maximum two-year period.</p>
<p>You'll receive a monthly invoice, with payment automatically taken from your Cloud Credits, if available. You'll need to inform our Finance department if you want to make any amendments to how your invoices are paid.</p>

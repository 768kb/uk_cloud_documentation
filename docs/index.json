    "keywords": "How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware Overview This guide leads you through the three basic steps for using UKCloud for VMware to quickly build a simple virtual machine (VM) in vCloud Director, and connect it to the internet. For more information about how to use other vCloud Director functions to make the most of UKCloud for VMware and create more complex virtual data centres (VDCs), take a look at the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . The three steps covered in this guide are: Create a network (to move requests around your VMs) Configure the edge gateway (in this guide we focus on the firewall and NAT configuration) Create a virtual machine If you follow these steps, you can have a VM up and running with a connection to the internet in about 20 to 25 minutes. Before you begin You should have received your UKCloud Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator. You should have created a VDC, compute service and edge gateway within your account. For more information, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . The steps in this guide assume that you've converted your edge gateway to an advanced edge. For more information, see Converting your edge gateway We recommend that you use the Mozilla Firefox ESR browser as this is supported by the Web Console for the version of vCloud Director used by UKCloud for VMware. For more information, see Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud Platform . Create a network Before you can start building VMs in your VDC, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other and the outside world. First, you need to create a network that can connect to external networks outside your VDC (including the internet). This is called an external routed network . Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal Select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create your VM. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Double-click your VDC (or right-click the VDC and choose Open ). You're creating a network, so select the Org VDC Networks tab. To create a new network, click the green + icon (or right-click an empty row and choose Add Network ) to open the New Organization VDC Network dialog box. You want your VM to connect to the internet (rather than just other VMs in the same VDC), so in the Select Network Type page, choose the routed network option. When you connect a network to the outside world, it's important that you control exactly what can access your environment via that network. The UKCloud platform provides each VDC with an edge gateway to do this, so select the edge that you want your new network to use and then click Next (we'll work more with the edge gateway later on). In the Configure Network page, enter the details for the Gateway address , Network mask and Primary DNS . The example below uses 192.168.1.1 for the gateway, 255.255.255.0 for the mask and 8.8.8.8 for the DNS. A VM needs an IP address to identify it on the network. Use the Static IP pool field to identify the IP addresses that VMs connecting to this network can use. You can specify either individual IP addresses (static manual) or a range of IP addresses (static IP pool): For static manual, for each IP address that you want to use, enter the IP address and click Add . For example, if your default gateway is 192.168.1.1 , you can use 192.168.1.2 as a static manual IP address. Continue adding IP addresses as necessary. For static IP pool, enter the range of IP addresses to use and click Add . For example, if your default gateway is 192.168.1.1 , you can use the 192.168.1.10-192.168.1.100 range for your static IP pool, giving 91 usable internal IP addresses. Click Next . Give the network a Name and Description . You can make your network available to your other VDCs within the same region so that VMs can communicate with each other, regardless of which VDC they are in. For example, you may have a single repository server that provides updates for all the VMs in a region. For the purposes of this exercise, leave the Share this network option empty. Click Next to review your settings, and then click Finish . You can find more information about routed networks in How to create a routed VDC network . Configure the edge gateway The edge gateway is possibly the most complex part of the VDC because of its high level of functionality. The following exercise steps you through a quick way to configure the edge gateway to enable you to access the internet from a VM. If you are not already logged in to the UKCloud, log in now and select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . Select the Administration tab. Double-click your VDC (or right-click the VDC and choose Open ). This time you're working with the edge gateway, so select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway you want to work with and choose Edge Gateway Services . Note The steps that follow describe how to change the edge gateway settings for an advanced gateway. Each tab in the Edge Gateway page provides access to a different service provided by the edge gateway. The main tabs are: Firewall - As well as a physical firewall, you can control which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway. You'll set up some firewall rules later in this exercise. DHCP - The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to Org networks connected to an edge. The DHCP tab shows DHCP information for any Org networks that have been configured with DHCP, and so acts as a centralised view. For more information, see How to create a DHCP pool . NAT - Network address translation, both in (DNAT) and out (SNAT) of the edge gateway. You'll set up some NAT rules later in this exercise. Routing - You can provide static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example networks in other VDCs in your compute service. For more information, see How to create a static route . Load Balancer - The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin. For more information, see How to configure a load balancer . VPN - IPsec site‑to‑site VPN is available on the edge gateway. It can be configured within the vCloud user interface, but may require additional configuration through the API. For more information, see How to configure IPsec VPN . To access the internet from a VM, you'll need to create firewall rules to determine who can access your network and NAT rules to route traffic within your network. Let's start with the firewall rules. Select the Firewall tab and make sure the Enabled option is selected. Click the + button to add a new row to the firewall rules table. Edit the values in the row for the New Rule using the settings below: Name - HTTPS outbound Source - internal Destination - external Service - Click the + button and enter the following values in the Add Service dialog box Protocol - TCP Source Port - any Destination Port - 443 Click Keep when you're done. Action - Accept These settings allow traffic from the VMs ( Source = internal ) to reach destinations outside your VDC ( Destination = external ) on port 443 . You'll need to repeat these steps for ports 80 and 53 . You can also allow traffic to reach your VMs from outside your VDC by swapping the Source and Destination values. However, because this opens up your firewall to a lot of traffic, we recommend that you first complete this guide to get comfortable with general networking concepts, and then take a look at the information in How to create firewall rules where you can find out how to lock the firewall down. Click Save changes Now that you've set up the firewall rules, you can create NAT rules, so select the NAT tab. Click the + SNAT Rule button to create a source NAT (SNAT) rule to translate internal IP addresses into something that the external network can understand. In the Add SNAT Rule dialog box, from the Applied on list, choose the edge gateway to which you want to apply the SNAT rule. In the Original Source IP/Range field, enter the range of addresses you created when you created the network in the previous exercise. In the Translated Source IP/Range field, enter one or more of the external IP addresses provided to you by UKCloud. If you are not sure what your IP addresses are, see How to find your allocated external IP addresses . When you're done, click Keep and then Save changes . You can also add destination NAT (DNAT) rules to translate external IP addresses to route traffic to the appropriate internal addresses. However, because the firewall only provides outbound access to the internet, we don't need to add DNAT rules at the moment. You can find more information about setting up NAT rules in How to create NAT rules . Create a virtual machine Now that you've laid the groundwork, it's time to create your VM. The best way to do this is to create a virtual application (vApp). You can think of a vApp as a container for your VMs—it enables you to group related VMs together to manage them in one place. See How to create a vApp to find out more. If you are not already logged in to the UKCloud, log in now and select your account. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . In this exercise, you'll create the vApp from scratch, so on the Home tab, click the Build New vApp button. In the New vApp dialog, give the vApp a Name and Description . From the Virtual Datacenter list, choose your VDC. For the purposes of this exercise, you can keep the default Runtime lease and Storage lease , so click Next . In the Add Virtual Machines page, you can create your VM. Add a VM from the UKCloud public catalog by choosing Public Catalogs from the Look in list. Find and select the VM that you want to use, click the Add button and then click Next . You can use the filter fields to limit which VMs appear in the list and use the arrow buttons to scroll through the results. On the Configure Resources page, you can change the VM name in the Virtual Machine field, but keep the default Storage Policy option. Click Next . On the Configure Virtual Machines page, from the Network list, select the externally routed network you created in the first exercise. From the IP Assignment list, choose Static -- IP Pool to use the IP pool you defined earlier when you created your network. You also have another opportunity here to change the name of the VM (in the Computer Name field). Click Next . You don't need to change anything on the Configure Networking page, so click Next . You can find out about network fencing in How to create a vApp network . On the Ready to Complete page, review your settings and then click Finish to start the deployment. When the VM has been provisioned, right-click it and select Power On , then use the popout console to go through the setup procedure. To confirm that you have connectivity to the internet and have an assigned IP address: Type ipconfig into the Command Prompt. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VM will return an IP address. Open an internet browser page and navigate to an external web page Ping the IP address of your DNS (for example, 8.8.8.8 ) through the command line. Next steps In this guide, you've learned how to build a simple virtual machine and connect it to the internet.

The UKCloud Portal provides the ability to build an edge gateway, without having to raise a service request. You can also create edge gateways using the Portal API. For more information, see the UKCloud Portal API User Guide . Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you must be a vCloud Director administrator. Building an edge gateway If your VDC is located on the Assured OFFICIAL security domain, its edge gateway provides access to the internet. If your VDC is located on the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain, its edge gateway provides access to your other VDCs in the Elevated OFFICIAL domain. Note You can build edge gateways in any of your compute services in regions 5 or 6, not just those you created using the Portal. For information about building compute services and VDCs, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create the edge gateway. Note To create an edge gateway using the Portal, the compute service must be in region 5 or 6. From the Actions menu, select Build Edge Gateway . Note If this option is greyed out, either you do not have the appropriate permissions or your compute service is not in region 5 or 6. On the Build Edge Gateway page, from the Associated VDC list, select the VDC for which you are creating the edge gateway. The VDC names in the list include information about the security domain in which the VDC is located and the VM type of the VDC. Note The list of VDCs includes all VDCs in the compute service, whether or not they already have an edge gateway. If you select a VDC that already has an edge gateway of the same type, you will get an error. Click Build . The Edge Gateway Build Status page displays information about the edge gateway you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can now start configuring the edge gateway. For a quick guide on how to do this, see How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware . If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Next steps After you create your edge gateway, we recommend that you convert it to an advanced gateway to access the latest vCloud Director functionality.

    "keywords": "How to access syslog data for your edge gateway Overview Your edge gateway is globally configured to send syslog messages to a specific IP address ( 100.127.255.250 ). By configuring a new network or IP address within your virtual data centre (VDC) and deploying a collector with the syslog IP address, you can access your edge gateway syslog data. You can then use this data to check: Allowed and denied network traffic Load balancer statistics Load balancer health This guide explains the network configuration required to provision a syslog collector within your VDC to receive syslog information direct from your edge gateway. Collecting syslog data for a single edge gateway The simplest scenario is to gather syslog data from a single edge gateway into one collector. To do this you need to create a routable location for the syslog IP address, by either: Adding the syslog IP address to an existing network interface card (NIC) on a routed subnet Add the syslog IP address to a subnet on the routed network. For example, if your existing monitoring server has a NIC on eth0 (for example, 10.0.1.10 ), on routed Org VDC network 10.0.1.0/24 , you'd add the syslog IP address to eth0 . Add a route on the vCNS Edge that routes the syslog IP address via the subnet. For example, route 100.127.255.250 MASK 255.255.255.255 via 10.0.1.10 . Configure the software on your existing monitoring server to capture data from the IP address of the vCNS edge. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Configuring a new routed network Create a new routed network with the following details: Org Network Name: Customer defined Gateway: 100.127.255.249 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248 DNS: Customer defined Static IP Pool: 100.127.255.250 -- 100.127.255.254 You can find more detailed steps for creating a routed network in How to create a routed VDC network . Deploy a new syslog server connected to the new routed network with a static address of 100.127.255.250 and install and configure the syslog server's edge gateway. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Collecting syslog data for multiple edge gateways If you have multiple edge gateways under a single NFT you can gather the data from all those edges into the same syslog collector. Set up a single syslog collector for one of your vCNS Edges as described in the previous section. Note We'll refer to this edge gateway as the syslog edge and all the other edge gateways as source edges . Confirm that you can see the local syslog traffic from the local syslog edge. Create a firewall rule on the syslog edge to allow syslog traffic from the source edges' TRANSIT IPs ( 172.26. x . x in Assured or 172.26. LOWER OCTET . x in Elevated) through to the syslog server IP. You can create individual rules using the following suggestions: <SOURCE TRANSIT IP>:Any to 100.127.255.250 on UDP Any:Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP <NFT TRANSIT CIDR/SUBNET>:Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP On each of the source edges, create a static route to direct traffic to the syslog edge. Use the following settings: Applied On: <nft_network> Name: Syslog traffic (or any other name you prefer) Network: 100.127.255.248/29 Next Hop IP: The TRANSIT IP address of the syslog edge Syslog packets from each source edge will now be forwarded to the syslog edge, with the source of the syslog traffic being the TRANSIT IP of the source edge. Perform a packet capture on the syslog collector to confirm it's receiving packets from the source edges. Note You may have to enable or disable logging on firewall rules to trigger syslog traffic. When you've confirmed that your syslog collector is receiving the syslog data, configure your syslog server to capture packets from the new syslog source. Enabling logging After setting up your syslog collector, you need to make sure that your edge gateway sends network traffic to the log. Edit your vCNS Edge firewall settings to log firewall rules: You must log each rule individually by selecting the Log network traffic for firewall rule option: To log data for actions not covered by individual rules, select the Log option next to the Default action setting: You can find more detailed steps for editing firewall settings in How to create firewall rules .

Tip If you've forgotten your password, click the Forgotten password? link to request a password reset. If this is the first time you've logged in, use the temporary password you were given by your Portal administrator or CSM. You'll be prompted to change this temporary password. If your Portal administrator has enabled memorable word authentication or Google Two Factor Authentication (2FA), you'll be prompted for the second step of your authentication process. For example, for memorable word authentication, you'll be prompted to enter three randomly‑selected letters from your memorable word. (If this is the first time you've logged in, you'll be prompted to create a memorable word.) For more information about the UKCloud Portal and all the functionality it provides, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . Creating your UKCloud for VMware estate When you first access UKCloud for VMware, you'll need to create a compute service (sometimes called a vOrg) to act as a top-level container for your cloud resources. As your estate grows, you can add more compute services to logically organise your resources. Within your compute service, you create VDCs to contain your VMs. VMs in the same VDC share workload characteristics and have access to the same resources, such as networking infrastructure, storage and external connectivity. We recommend that you organise related VMs within vApps to make your applications easier to manage. For example, you can start all the VMs within a vApp with a single operation, rather than having to start up each VM separately. vApps are also useful to help maintain crash‑consistency within an application in the event of a disaster. Building a compute service If you have the appropriate permissions, you can use the Portal to create a compute service in your account, without having to raise a support ticket. In the UKCloud Portal, select the account in which you want to create the compute service. In the navigation panel, expand Tools and then select Create Compute Service . On the Build Compute Service page, from the Zone radio buttons, select the zone in which you want to create the new compute service. Note In the Portal, you can create compute services only in zones in regions 5 and 6. Enter a Compute Service Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except +. Click Build . The Build Compute Service Status page displays information about the compute service you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VDCs in your compute service (see Building a virtual data centre ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Building a virtual data centre After creating your compute service, the next step is to create one or more VDCs. Note You can build VDCs in any of your compute services in regions 5 and 6, including those created by support tickets or the Portal API, not just those you created using the Portal. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create the VDC. Note To create a VDC using the Portal, the compute service must be in region 5 or 6. From the Actions menu, select Build VDC . Note If this option is greyed out, either you do not have the appropriate permissions or your compute service is not in region 5 or 6. On the Build VDC page, from the VM Type radio buttons, select the option that describes the characteristics of the workload of the VDC: ESSENTIAL ---For lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. VMs in the VDC can have contended compute resource allocation (CPU/RAM) and automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance. POWER ---For key workloads that are resource intensive, such as web and application workloads, mid-sized databases and caching services. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY ---For critical workloads that handle important business processes that benefit from a steady state of operation. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform. Enter a VDC Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except +. Click Build . The VDC Build Status page displays information about the VDC you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VMs. To provide external access to the VDC, you'll need to create an edge gateway (see How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Logging in to vCloud Director After you've created your compute service and VDC, you can start to build up your applications. To do this, you must log in to vCloud Director, which you can access from the UKCloud Portal. In the Portal navigation panel expand VMware Cloud then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, for additional security, re-enter your UKCloud Portal password, then click Confirm . vCloud Director launches in your browser window. Note If this is the first time you've opened vCloud Director, you may be requested to download the vCloud Director Web Console plugin. Tip If you encounter any issues, make sure you're using the Firefox ESR 32-bit browser. For more information, see Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud Platform . The tasks you can perform in vCloud Director will depend on the permissions you have been granted. More information!

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access Overview Intended audience This document is for customers who have: Completed the UKCloud Assurance Wrap Been approved to use the Secure Remote Access (SRA) service to manage services in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain on the UKCloud platform Post approval Once the SRA Assurance Wrap has been approved, we'll raise a service request for the implementation of the SRA virtual data centre (vDC) and, if needed, an Elevated (formerly IL3) vDC. (If a service request for this vDC implementation already exists, a new one won't be raised.) You can track the progress of the service request using the UKCloud Portal. During creation of the UKCloud SRA vDC, we'll ask you for some additional information via the service request: Confirm the customer account number in Elevated as a new Org will be created under the account to contain the SRA vDC. The Org number will be used as an identifier when signing certificates. The preferred IP pool you want to use for your client devices. If the IP Pool you'd prefer is in use by another customer then another will have to be chosen. We'll inform you if this is the case. If you want to specify an IP from the IP pool for each device, we'll need you to supply the mapping. Any specified DNS servers. The Elevated Network Firewall Tenant (NFT) number and the Elevated organisation containing it for connection into Elevated. A certificate signing request for each remote access device. Certificate signing request generation To enable SRA access, we'll need the certificate-signing request (CSR) from each remote access device you'll be using. The certificate-generation process will vary depending on the OS of the client device. Windows Follow the steps below to generate the CSR for a Windows device. Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, double-click Personal and then click Certificates . On the Actions menu, point to All Tasks , point to Advanced Options and then click Create Custom Request to start the Certificate Enrolment wizard. Click Next . On the Custom request page, in the Templates list, we recommend using the Custom Request option as your domain policy may be incompatible with the SRA service. Select Proceed without enrolment policy and click Next . Select (No template) CNG key and ensure the PKCS#10 radio button is selected, then click Next . At the Certificate Information page, click the down arrow next to Details then click the Properties button. Click the Private Key tab, then the down arrow to the right of Key options . Change the Key size to 2048 and click Apply . Optional: If you want to back up the certificate (to protect against client device failure) click the check boxes for the private key . You'll be asked for a password. For the file format, select Base 64 and then save the CSR. Linux For Linux, an equivalent OpenSSL command would be the following: openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myserver.key -out server.csr Ensure that the key file is preserved for the later installation steps below, as withouth this the AnyConnect client will not be able to connect the SRA service. CSR submission to UKCloud We request that you paste the contents of the CSR file directly into a ticket for us to generate the associated certificate(s), but you can also email it to us if you cannot access the Portal. VPN Cisco AnyConnect client setup To access yoru SRA VDC you need to download the Cisco AnyConnect client and install it on your remote access devices. For each OS there is the main Cisco AnyConnect client software install and an additional executable to enable the FIPS capability. You need to run both. Linux Download link https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/a0e452d8-cd7b-49a4-a3ca-f791620cb084 Install the AnyConnect client tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-k9.tar.gz cd anyconnect-<version number>-/vpn sudo ./vpn_install.sh Enable FIPS tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS.tar.gz ./ anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS Windows Download link https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/9af4958c-04c0-4ae1-8eb2-2733dc8042ce Install the AnyConnect client The windows installation has the option of .msi or .iso (that contains the .msi ) for the AnyConnect client image. The following installs may need to be run as administrator depending on the local policy of your Windows device. Right click on the anyconnect-win-<version number>-pre-deploy.msi and select Install. Enable FIPS Double click anyconnect-EnableFIPS-win-<version number>.exe and then enter y when asked at the command prompt. Mac Download link https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/e8b2d284-ec20-45e4-aed6-5a6071299064 AnyConnect client software We'll make the latest Cisco AnyConnect client software available via the Knowledge Centre using the links above. Using the latest version of the AnyConnect client will probably be a requirement of your ITSHC or service assurance wrap so it will be worth checking the above articles periodically. If a client is upgraded from a previous install then the following post installation steps will need to be performed again to ensure the client configuration isn't reverted to the default. Post-installation configuration Once you've installed the AnyConnect software and certificates on your device, you need to install the connection profile which is available in the Knowledge Centre ( https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/25a7111c-139e-4fd2-a52c-3412689bf1d3 ). Unzip the file and copy the xml to the following location: OS type CPA XML location Linux/Mac /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile Windows C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\Profile For Linux only In addition to the AnyConnect profile, you also need to install a local policy which is available in the Knowledge Centre: https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/2effd0b2-1eda-4999-87a6-6140e5fc07ea Unzip the file and copy it to: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml . Once you've copied the connection profile and local policy to the correct locations, you need to restart the AnyConnect service (using the command service vpnagentd restart ) or reboot the VM. SRA certificates Once the SRA vDC has been set up (and Elevated vDC, if needed), we'll send you an email containing the certificates we've generated (based on the CSR sent to us as above) which you need to install onto your remote access devices. For each customer SRA service a unique IssuingCA certificate is generated and used to sign each individual device certificates. The IssuingCA certificate along with the specific certificate for the device will be emailed. Both the certificates need to be installed. The certificates sent through will named as below: IssuingCA – clientcert.pem Device Certificate - E51FFC7D50C<HEX VALUE>.pem Windows certificate store Follow the steps below to import the certificates into the Windows certificate store. This assumes that you have the certificates we sent accessible to the MMC: Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc , and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, open Trusted Root Certification Authorities , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the IssuingCA sent to you, double click clientcert.pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Trusted Root Certification Authorities selected then click Next then Finish . In the console tree, open Personal , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the device certificate sent to you, double click E51FFC7D50C .pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Personal selected then click Next then Finish . Using the example customer SRAS-1-1-2 you should now see the client certificate in the Personal store. Double click it and as in the examples pictures below: In the General tab it should say \"You have a private key that corresponds to this certificate\". The UID should be displayed the Details tab in the Subject line in the format SRAS-1-1-2- The certification path listed in the Certification Path tab as highlighted in the example below should show the IssuingCA Linux certificate store The Linux certificate store is just a file structure under the root or user account depending on how you use Linux OS. For the Linux client to work the following must be true: All certificate files must end with the extension .pem All private key files must end with the extension .key A client certificate and its corresponding private key must have the same filename. For example client.pem and client.key Using the example customer issued certificate SRAS1-1-2-001.pem the files would be stored in the following locations for root. The key file generated above needs to moved and renamed appropriately. PEM file certificate store folders Type of certificates stored ~/.cisco/certificates/client/private/SRAS1-1-2-001.key Private keys ~/.cisco/certificates/client/SRAS1-1-2-001.pem Client certificates ~/.cisco/certificates/ca/clientcert.pem Trusted CA and root certificates Connecting to SRA Once connected to your SRA VPN, you can access your SRA walled garden via IP address or DNS name (if you have a DNS set up). Client connection methods are listed below. Linux Once you've restarted AnyConnect and installed the certificates, you can use the client with the following command line: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn connect sra01.ukcloud.com Or if you use a Linux desktop the client software should be available as an icon. Windows When you open the AnyConnect client you'll see a small window appear and the location of the SRA service should be populated: Click the Connect button and after a couple of status checks the client should scan the certificate store and offer the relevant certificate to initiate access. Select the certificate and click OK . Accessing the UKCloud Portal using SRA There is no direct access to the Elevated portal once the AnyConnect client connects. In most instances we'll create a virtual machine (VM) within the SRA VDC that you can VPN into in order to log in to the Elevated portal to provision and manage your SRA and Elevated VDC. Once this VM is deployed, it becomes your responsibility to manage and maintain it. This VM will be billed according to standard UKCloud billing process. Addresses to hit the Elevated portal and vCloud Director API can be obtained by raising a support ticket through the UKCloud Portal.

    "title": "How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to manage Snapshot Protection for your VMs Overview Protection technologies are tools used to enable you to design resilience into your cloud solutions. They protect data and provide you with the ability to recover from system outages - either caused by a disruption to the physical delivery of a service or as a result of corruption of your primary system. The UKCloud platform offers a variety of protection options, including Snapshot Protection. Snapshot Protection automatically takes an image of your virtual machine (VM) every 24 hours and stores the image outside the core platform for either 14 or 28 days, depending on your chosen snapshot retention profile. How does Snapshot Protection work? By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. If you want Snapshot Protection for your VM, you must explicitly add it. When you add Snapshot Protection to a VM, the VM is added to a daily automated backup. Backups are automatically taken for the VM once every 24 hours, sometime between the hours of 2000 and 0800. The status of a VM's backup is reported daily in the UKCloud Portal by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. If you encounter a problem with your VM, raise a Service Request and we can use one of your VM backups to restore the whole VM image to a new VM in your VDC. You can then use this image to restore the VM or restore any required data to your original VM. For more detailed information, see the Snapshot Protection Service Scope . Checking a VM's Snapshot Protection status You can use the UKCloud Portal to see whether a VM uses Snapshot Protection, find out which snapshot retention policy is currently applied to a VM, or check the status of your VM's snapshots. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the account that the VM belongs to. Click My VMs . Select the compute service (vOrg) that the VM belongs to. Select the My VMs tab. From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that the VM belongs to. Click the VMs tab. The icon in Snapshot Protection column shows the status of each VM's most recent backup: - Excluded from backup (if you have recently added Snapshot Protection to a VM, this icon indicates that a backup does not yet exist for the VM) - Backup successful - Backup unsuccessful The button in the Snapshot Protection column shows the Snapshot Protection option currently applied to the VM: 14‑day - VM uses Snapshot Protection, with backups retained for 14 days 28-day - VM uses Snapshot Protection, with backups retained for 28 days Manage - VM is currently excluded from Snapshot Protection Processing - A change in status to Snapshot Protection is currently being processed for the VM Failed - A change in the status of Snapshot Protection for the VM failed; contact the UKCloud support team to resolve this issue. To find out more detail about the most recent backup of a VM, or to view information about previous backups, click the VM name. In the VMs Info page, the following fields provide information about the most recent backup of the VM: Additional information - additional information about the backup, for example if the backup was removed from the daily automated backup, if the retention period was changed, or further details of any failures. Last backup - the status of the most recent backup Retention length - how long the backup will be kept for: 14 days or 28 days Backup status - when the most recent backup was attempted The Snapshot Protection Backups section of the page provides information about previous backups. This covers the entire retention policy period (14 or 28 days). Information includes: Status - the status of the backup Slot - the backup slot during which the backup was taken Start - the date and time when the backup started End - the date and time when the backup ended Snapshot Removal Start - the date and time when the snapshot consolidation process started (that is, writing back any changes to the VM that occurred during the time it was locked for backup) Snapshot Removal End - the date and time when the snapshot consolidation process ended The Snapshot Protection Policy History section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot retention policy for the VM. Status - The status of the policy change Date Requested - The date and time when the policy change was requested User - The user who requested the change Protection Period - The new protection period introduced by the policy change Reason for Change - The reason for the policy change Action - The type of policy change request Click Manage my Backups to raise a service request related to your backups, for example, to restore a backup. To view all the VM information in a single table, click the Actions tab and select Export VMs . You can save this page to view offline and analyse further. Managing Snapshot Protection for a VM By default, VMs deployed on the UKCloud platform do not come with any protection services enabled. You can use the UKCloud Portal to add Snapshot Protection to your VM. You can also use the Portal to change the snapshot retention policy for your backups and to remove Snapshot Protection from your VM. Access the My VMs tab for your compute service. For detailed steps for how to do this, see the first few steps in Checking a VM's snapshot status . From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that the VM belongs to. Click the VMs tab. In the Snapshot Protection column, click the green button. The label on the button will depend on the currently applied policy: Manage if there is currently no snapshot retention policy applied to the VM 14-day if the VM's snapshot retention policy is currently 14 days 28-day if the VM's snapshot retention policy is currently 28 days In the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, from the New Protection Policy list, select the snapshot retention policy that you want to apply to the VM: 14-day to apply a 14-day snapshot retention policy to the VM 28-day to apply a 28-day snapshot retention policy to the VM No Backup to turn Snapshot Protection off for the VM > [!NOTE] > If you remove Snapshot Protection from a VM, you should consider alternatives to ensure the integrity of your data in the case of disruption. In addition to Snapshot Protection, UKCloud offers Synchronous Protection and Journaling Protection options, or you may want to implement your own protection solution, possibly utilising our Cloud Storage service. In the Reason For Change field, provide a reason for the change to the existing snapshot retention policy. Click Submit . The button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to an amber Processing button. When the changes have been applied, the button changes back to green with a label indicating the VM's snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. The amount of time it takes for your changes to take place depends on how many requests are in the queue. If there are any problems with the request, the button in the Snapshot Protection column changes to a red Failed button; in this situation, contact UKCloud Support for further assistance. Backup status information is updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Managing Snapshot Protection for a VDC You can specify a snapshot retention policy to apply to all the VMs in a VDC. You can apply the policy to all new VMs or to all new and existing VMs. Access the My VMs tab for your compute service. For detailed steps for how to do this, see the first few steps in Checking a VM's snapshot status . From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that you want to apply Snapshot Protection to. Select the Snapshot Protection tab. Next to Default VM Snapshot Protection , click the green button. The label on the button will depend on the currently applied policy: Manage if there is currently no default snapshot retention policy applied to the VDC 14-day if the default snapshot retention policy is currently 14 days 28-day if the default snapshot retention policy is currently 28 days In the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, from the New Protection Policy list, select the snapshot retention policy that you want to apply to the VMs in this VDC: 14-day if you want to apply a 14-day snapshot retention policy to the VDC 28-day if you want to apply a 28-day snapshot retention policy to the VDC No Backup if you do not want to apply a default snapshot retention policy to the VDC In the Reason For change field, provide a reason for the change to the existing snapshot retention policy. If you want to apply the chosen snapshot retention policy to existing VMs in the VDC as well as new VMs, select the Apply new policy to all existing VMs? check box. Note If you select this check box, all existing VMs will switch to the new policy when you click Submit. You will not be able to rollback this change. Click Submit . The label of the Default VM Snapshot Protection button changes to indicate the new snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or to Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. Any new VMs created within the VDC will now use the specified snapshot retention policy, although you can override this for individual VMs if required by following the steps in Managing snapshot protection for a VM . If you selected Apply to all existing VMs , the button changes to an amber Processing button. When the changes have been applied, the button changes back to green with a label indicating the VDC's snapshot retention policy ( 14-day or 28-day ) or Manage if you have turned off Snapshot Protection. If the VDC contains a lot of VMs, the process of updating the policy for all existing VMs may take several minutes to complete. Backup status information is updated daily on the UKCloud Portal by 1000, but typically within minutes of the close of the backup window. Note When you exit the Snapshot Protection Policy dialog box, the Currently viewing for VDC list on the My VMs tab resets to the first VDC listed under the compute service. You'll need to reselect your VDC from the list before continuing. The Default Snapshot Protection Policy History section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot protection policy for the VDC. The Recent VM Snapshot Protection Policy Actions section of the page lists any recent changes to the snapshot protection policy for VMs in the VDC. Monitoring the status of Snapshot Protection You can monitor the status of Snapshot Protection across an entire compute service to get a general overview of how your VDCs and VMs are protected. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the account that the compute service belongs to. In the navigation panel, expand Reports and click Backup Summary . Click the link for the compute service for which you want to view Snapshot Protection information. The Snapshot Protection Summary page provides the following information for the selected compute service: Success Rate (Last 24 Hours) - The percentage of successful VM backups in the previous night's backups Success Rate (Within Retention Period) - The overall percentage success rate of all backups across the compute service Number of VMs Protected - The total number of VMs successfully protected in the previous night's backups Number of VMs Not Protected - The total number of VMs with Snapshot Protection that were not successfully protected in the previous night's backups VM Snapshot Protection Failures - A list of the VMs that encountered a Snapshot Protection failure in previous night's backups Next steps For more information about working with your VMs, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware .

Note Although you can build a VM to your own specification in terms of the number of vCPUs, and amount of memory and disk space, you'll be billed based on the closest (next highest) match to a UKCloud pre-defined VM size. Given the flexibility of VMs, and the ability to change the number of vCPUs and amount of memory and disk space on the fly, it's often better to start small as you're not tied by the constraints of a physical server. Remember too that more vCPUs or RAM won't necessarily make a server faster, and could cost a lot more. You need to understand how well your application can make use of multi-threading. Leave Bus type as the default. Select the Number of NICs (network interface cards) you need in the first instance. When you're finished, click OK then click Next . On the Configure Resources page, select the Storage Policy for the VM and click Next .

The address may vary with each boot, but there is a checkbox to keep IP address assignments elsewhere within the UI once the VMs are created. Static - Manual is similar to Static - IP Pool, but you need to type in a valid IP address from the pool, which the VM will then keep. DHCP vCloud Director interacts with the OS via VMware Tools to use DHCP rather than static IPs. You'll need to define a DHCP server on your edge gateway. Check with UKCloud or your organisation administrator that this is set up before you use it. Click Next . On the Configure Networking page you can change how the vApp and its virtual machines connect to the VDC networks. You can find out about network fencing in How to create a vApp network .

    "keywords": "How to create a vApp Overview vCloud Director uses vApps to make virtual machine (VM) creation and management easy and flexible. vApps are essentially containers for VMs and can be used in many ways. One of the most common uses of a vApp is to group similar VMs together for easy management. Or you can put VMs that form a multi-tier application into the same vApp for greater control. Up to 128 vApps can be created within a virtual data centre (VDC) and intelligently networked to create complex architectures that can be managed easily. In this guide we'll look at how to create a vApp from scratch. Creating a vApp In vCloud Director, on the Home tab, click the Build New vApp button. Enter a name for your vApp. This should be a name that will easily identify it if you're building a large environment with multiple vApps. If you have multiple VDCs on the UKCloud platform, you can decide later which one the new vApp sits in. You can also choose how long the vApp can exist for, which is useful for test & dev projects. When you're happy with these settings, click Next . You can now populate the vApp with VMs. There are several ways to create a VM: From an existing template. The template can be in your own organisation's catalogue or in UKClouds's public catalogue (see How to create a VM from a template ). Catalogue creation is covered in How to create a catalog .

    "keywords": "How to create a vApp network Overview In addition to virtual data centre (VDC) networking, you can create individual vApp networks to have even greater control over your network infrastructure. vApp networks enable you to create smaller networks within individual vApps that have a vApp edge, similar to the edge gateway on your VDC. Although a vApp edge isn't as feature rich as a VDC edge, it enables you to create firewall and NAT rules to separate your VDC networks from your vApp virtual machines (VMs). This means you can create some quite complex networks to satisfy application needs. The example of a vApp network, below, shows the vApp edge. Creating a vApp network There are two ways to create a vApp network within vCloud Director: During vApp creation After vApp creation Creating a vApp network during vApp creation Follow the steps for creating a new vApp as shown in How to create a vApp . When you get to the Configure Virtual Machines page, where you select the network you want your VMs to connect to, from the Network list, select Add Network . Tip The Add Network option is at the bottom of the Network list, so you may have to scroll down the list to find it. On the Network Specification page of the New vApp Network Wizard , fill out the fields as required for your network then click Next . Some options are pre-populated by default; you can change them if you want. On the General page, enter a Network name and Description , then click Next and Finish . Your newly created vApp network is now included in the Network list. Your newly created vApp network is now included in the Network list. If you want to connect multiple VMs within the vApp to the new vApp network, go through and make sure they will all connect to it. When you're done, click Next . On the Configure Networking page, to connect the vApp network to an external VDC network, from the Connection list, select the VDC network that you want to connect to. In the Routing column, select whether to apply NAT and Firewall rules to the vApp edge (you can always change this later), then click Next . On the Ready to Complete page, review your configuration, then click Finish to deploy the vApp. Creating a vApp network after vApp creation If you've created a vApp that is connected to a VDC network, and now you want to convert it to a vApp with an internal network: On the My Cloud tab, double-click the vApp to open it. As you're going to be changing network settings, all VMs within the vApp must be powered off, so, if necessary, on the Virtual Machines tab, right-click each VM and select Power Off . Select the Networking tab. Click the green + icon to add a new network. On the Network Type page of the New vApp Network Wizard , select vApp network then click Next . On the Network Specification page of the New vApp Network Wizard , fill out the fields as required for your network then click Next . Some options are pre-populated by default; you can change them if you want. On the General page, enter a Network name and Description , then click Next and Finish . Your newly created vApp network is now included in the Network list. To connect the vApp network to an external VDC network, from the Connection list, select the VDC network that you want to connect to. In the Routing column, select whether to apply NAT and Firewall rules to the vApp edge (you can always change this later), then click Next . When you're done, click Apply at the bottom of the page. If your vApp is already populated with VMs that are connected to a VDC network, you may want to move them over to the vApp network. To change the network a VM connects to, on the vApp Diagram tab, right-click the VM and select Properties . In the Virtual Machine Properties dialog box, select the Hardware tab. In the NICs section, from the Networks list, select the vApp network to connect the VM to. If you want to dual-home your VM, click the Add button to add a second network. When you're done, click OK . You can go back to the VM properties to see the new IP address assigned to the VM. Viewing and adjusting vApp network settings When you've created your vApp network and assigned VMs to it, you may want to review the vApp network settings and adjust them if needed. On the My Cloud tab, open the vApp you want to work with then select the Networking tab. Right-click the vApp network and select Configure Services . You can now view the default network services and change them if necessary. Enabling DHCP DHCP isn't enabled by default. To enable it, on the DHCP page of the Configure Services dialog box, select the Enable DHCP check box, enter appropriate information then click OK . For more information about DHCP, see How to create a DHCP pool . Creating firewall rules There will be a rule in place to allow any traffic to traverse the firewall. You can amend or delete this rule, or create new rules. On the Firewall page of the Configure Services dialog box, select the rule you want to edit, then click Edit For more about firewall rules, see How to create firewall rules . Creating NAT rules NAT rules, enabled by default, enable mapping between internal VM interfaces and external IP addresses. To edit the mapping rules for a VM: On the NAT page of the Configure Services dialog box, select the rule you want to edit and click Edit . In the Edit IP Translation Rule dialog box, select the VM interface for which you want to edit the NAT rule. From the Mapping Mode list, select the mapping mode. The default mapping is Automatic . You can change this to Manual , in which case, enter an External IP address to which the VM can map. When you're done, click OK . The external IP address will be on the same subnet as the VDC network that connects to the vApp Edge. For more information about NAT rules, see How to create NAT rules . Creating static routes Static routing at the vApp network level allows traffic to route between different vApp networks, across the VDC networks. The prerequisites for static routing are as follows: Static routing must be enabled for the VDC network you're connecting to (see How to create a static route ). The two vApp networks must be routed to the same VDC network. The vApp networks must be in vApps that have been started at least once. To add a static route: On the Static Routing page of the Configure Services dialog box, click Add In the Add Static Route dialog box, enter a Name for the static route. Enter the following details: Network - The address of the first vApp network to which you're adding a static route Next Hop IP - The external IP address of that vApp network's router When you're done, click OK . Repeat for the second vApp network. The tables below provides examples of the settings needed to create a static route between two vApps. Network Information Network name Network specification Router external IP address vApp network 1 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.0.100 vApp network 2 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.0.101 VDC network shared 192.168.0.0/24 N/A Static routing settings Static route to network Route name Network Next hop IP address vApp network 1 To-vapp1 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.0.100 vApp network 2 To-vapp2 192.168.2.0/24 192.168.0.101 Note Make sure your firewall rules allow traffic on the static routes. vApp fencing Fencing a vApp allows identical VMs within different vApps to be powered on without conflict, by isolating the MAC and IP addresses of the VMs. This feature is particularly useful if you are copying vApps or creating catalog images of vApps where these details can't be altered. vApp fencing can be done during or after vApp creation. It is done when the VMs within the vApp sit on the VDC network, rather than on their own vApp network. To apply vApp fencing during vApp creation, select the Fence vApp check box on the Configure Networking page of the New vApp wizard. If you're converting a vApp after creation, on the My Cloud tab, open the vApp you want to fence, then, on the Networking tab, select the Fence vApp checkbox.

    "keywords": "How to create a catalog Overview UKCloud provides a public catalogue for you to use that contains standard virtual machine (VM) sizes and operating systems. The public catalogue is a good place to start when you first deploy VMs into the UKCloud platform. However, you may want to create your own catalogues, containing specific applications or gold images, which you can then use to deploy VMs quickly. The first step is to create an empty catalogue. Creating a catalog To create an empty catalogue: In vCloud Director, select the Catalogs tab. Click the + button to add a new catalogue. Name the catalogue and give it a description if needed. There's also an option to add a Subscribed Catalog, a read-only copy of an externally published catalogue. If you want to do this, you'll need to know the URL, and the password if there is one. When you're done, click Next . You now have the option to select the storage type used to store the catalog. The default is Use any storage . Leave this selected if you don't need to store catalog items on specific storage. Alternatively, you can indicate where your catalog items should be stored if they need to be stored on a specific storage policy. When you're done, click Next . To make the catalog visible to others, add specific people or your entire organisation. Click the Add Members button to add everyone in the organisation or individual users. You can give individuals different access levels. When you've added all the people who can access the catalogue, click OK , then review each individual's access level and adjust it if needed. When you're done, click Next . You now have the choice to publish your catalog for the use of external organisations. To enable external publishing, select the checkbox and add a password if needed. If you don't want to share your catalog externally, just click Next . Review the settings and click Finish . Populating a catalog There are two ways to populate a catalog: By uploading an OVF package By creating a template from an existing vApp Uploading an OVF package To upload an OVF package and assign it to a catalogue: On the Catalogs tab, select the vApp Templates tab. Click the Upload button to open an OVF upload window. In the Upload OVF package as a vApp Template dialog box, select the source of the OVF: either a URL or a Local file . Give a destination for the OVF, and give the OVF a name. From the Catalog list, select the catalog you want to put the OVF in. When you're done, click Upload to import the OVF into the catalog. Depending on template size and network speed, the upload may take some time. Adding an existing vApp To create a catalog from an existing vApp: In vCloud Director, select the My Cloud tab. Right-click the vApp you want to add to the catalog and select Add to Catalog . You can add both running and stopped vApps to the catalog, although it's worth noting that creating a catalog image from a running vApp could affect performance.

    "keywords": "Overview With the upgrade to vCloud Director 8.20, UKCloud for VMware now offers advanced gateways to provide access to new vCloud Director functionality. Some of this functionality is available now, with other features being added following integration testing to assess suitability on our platform (some features may incur additional charges). Advanced gateways in UKCloud for VMware provide: NSX Tenant Portal - The new Tenant Portal is a pure HTML5 user interface that you can use in conjunction with the legacy vCloud Director Web Console. This portal provides an initial set of controls to configure Advanced Gateway NSX Edges. New API NSX management - vCloud Director 8.20 introduces a new proxy API that enables vCloud API clients to make requests to the NSX API. Unlike the NSX API, which is designed to address NSX objects in a global scope, such as a vCenter database, the vCloud Director API for NSX is designed to address NSX objects within the scope of a vCloud Director tenant organisation. SSH edge access - If you enable SSH, you can perform your own packet captures and troubleshoot your edge gateway yourself, without having to contact UKCloud Support. Important After converting your edge gateway to an advanced gateway, the API endpoint for configuring edge services will change. Any tooling that you use to amend the edge service configuration, such as adding firewall rules, will no longer work in its current state. For more information about using the advanced gateway API, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide . Important After converting your edge to an advanced gateway, you will not be able to enable or disable logging on firewall rules via the advanced gateway GUI. To enable or disable logging, you must either use the API or raise a service request detailing the firewall rules for which you want to enable or disable logging so that we can action it on your behalf. When you convert an edge, the advanced gateway inherits the firewall logging configuration from the original edge. Enabling or disabling logging for NAT or load balancer services is not affected and you can edit those settings from the advanced gateway GUI as normal. For more information about using the API to amend firewall rules, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide . Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. Prerequisites and known issues Before converting your edge gateway, review the prerequisites and known issues below: Edge gateway version --- To convert to an advanced gateway, your edge gateway must be at version 6.2. x . If necessary, redeploy your edge gateway to upgrade to the latest version; for more information, see How to upgrade your edge gateway . Disabled firewalls - On an advanced gateway, if you disable the firewall, this also stops the NAT service, as it is dependent on the firewall. As a result, traffic flow that relies on NAT, such as NAT rules and the load balancer is stopped. If you attempt to disable the firewall service, the vCloud Director Web Console will display a warning. This is due to the firewall service being used to track stateful connections. See the following VMware Knowledge Base article for more information: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2093153 . If you convert an edge that already has the firewall disabled to an advanced gateway, the converted advanced gateway will have the firewall enabled, but with an Any, Any, Allow rule so that all traffic is allowed inbound or outbound. Internal/external keywords - Due to a bug in vCloud Director 8.20, when you create or amend firewall rules on your advanced gateway using the vCloud Director Web Console, you can no longer use the keywords internal or external when specifying the direction of the traffic. However, you can still use these keywords when using the API to create or amend rules. This Web Console bug is fixed in vCloud Director 9. x , which we'll be upgrading to in the coming months. For information about using the API to create or amend firewall rules, see the vCloud Director API for NSX Programming Guide . Converting your edge to an advanced gateway To access the latest vCloud Director networking features, you need to convert your edge to an advanced gateway. To convert your edge to an advanced gateway: Login to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the appropriate account. Click My VMs . Select the compute service (vOrg) that the edge gateway belongs to. On the vCloud Director tab, enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Confirm . In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Double-click the VDC that the edge gateway belongs to. Select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway that you want to convert and select Convert to Advanced Gateway . Click Yes to start the conversion. Important After converting your edge gateway, check the firewall rules to make sure that the default rule for ingress traffic is set to Deny . Next steps To find out more about the features provided by advanced gateways, see the following articles: Upgrade to vCloud Director 8.20 Feedback If you have any comments on this document or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, please send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

    "keywords": "How to connect to the UKCloud Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) Overview When you create a virtual machine (VM) running a Windows Server operating system, you need to register it with the UKCloud Windows Server Update Services to receive updates for it. Note UKCloud provides Windows updates for server operating systems and SQL. Before you establish a connection to the update services, you need to ensure your VMs can communicate with the update server, which exists outside your cloud organisation. This may involve editing the NAT and firewall settings on your edge gateway to allow traffic to traverse out of your virtual data centre (VDC). You'll need to open ports 443 and 80 on your firewall to the update server. For more information on how to do this, see How to create NAT rules and How to create firewall rules . Configuring Windows update In this section you'll need to replace the IP addresses of x.x.x.x with the IP address for the update server you're targeting. The IP address depends on whether your VMs are on the Assured OFFICIAL or Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. To get the IP addresses for the update servers, raise a service via My Calls in the UKCloud Portal. Open a console to the VM you want to update. Test connectivity to the update servers by opening an Internet Explorer browser window, then opening a connection to one of the update servers on https://x.x.x.x . Confirm that a certificate error displays. If it doesn't, connectivity hasn't been established and you'll need to troubleshoot the NAT and firewall rules before you continue. Confirm the certificate error, then click the certificate icon in the browser and select Show Certificate to show the Issued to: servername . Make a note of this servername for use in the next steps. Create the host file entry for x.x.x.x to resolve to the servername from the step above. Restart IE and open a connection to https://servername . Confirm that a certificate error displays, and confirm the certificate error. Click the certificate icon to display the certificate and click Install certificate . For Windows Server 2008: Select Place all certificates in the following store. In the Select Certificate Store select the option Show Physical Stores. Install the certificate into Trusted Root Certification authorities/local PC. For Windows Server 2012: On the welcome screen of the Certificate import wizard, select Local Machine, then click Next. Select Place all certificates in the following store, and click Browse. Highlight Trusted Root Certification Authorities and click OK. Click Next and confirm the import settings, then click Finish. Restart your browser and open a connection to https://servername . Confirm that no certificate warnings appear, and that the certificate icon in IE is green. Run gpedit.msc . In the Group Policy Management Editor, expand and navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update. Enable and configure the following settings: Specify intranet Microsoft update service location --- enter https://servername in both boxes Configure Automatic Updates --- enter required settings Enable client-side targeting --- enter client in the group name field Open an elevated command prompt and enter gpupdate /force . Open Windows update and click Check for updates. Replicating settings to other Windows VMs To quickly replicate the settings defined above to other windows VMs in your environment: Copy the update server record in the host file to the additional VMs. Export the certificate from the trusted root folder to a file and import it to the additional VMs. Export from the registry the key KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate and import it onto the additional VMs. Restart the Windows update service on the additional VMs. Feedback If you have any comments on this document or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

When you're finished, click OK . Creating the second VPN gateway You now need to create the endpoint of the VPN tunnel. If this is a different VDC (in the Elevated security domain) or vOrg, go through the steps described above again to create the tunnel. When you've done that, you can change your firewall settings and validate the connection (see below). If you're connecting to an external data centre, you'll need to set up the tunnel on that premises. Creating an external data centre VPN gateway Although we can't provide specific instructions on setting up an external data centre gateway to connect to the edge gateway, we've provided information about some configuration requirements below. IKE Phase 1 and Phase 2 IKE is a standard method for arranging secure, authenticated communications. Phase 1 parameters Phase 1 sets up mutual authentication of the peers, negotiates cryptographic parameters, and creates session keys. The Phase 1 parameters used by an advanced gateway are: Main mode AES/AES256/AES-GCM (user configurable) Diffie-Hellman Group Pre-shared secret (user configurable) SA lifetime of 28800 seconds (eight hours) with no kbytes rekeying ISAKMP aggressive mode disabled The Phase 1 parameters used by a standard edge are: Main mode TripleDES / AES (user configurable) SHA-1 MODP group 2 (1024 bits) Pre-shared secret (user configurable) SA lifetime of 28800 seconds (eight hours) with no kbytes rekeying ISAKMP aggressive mode disabled Phase 2 parameters IKE Phase 2 negotiates an IPSec tunnel by creating keying material for the IPSec tunnel to use (either by using the IKE phase 1 keys as a base or by performing a new key exchange). The IKE Phase 2 parameters supported by an advanced gateway are: AES/AES256/AES-GCM (Will match the Phase 1 setting) ESP tunnel mode Diffie-Hellman Group Perfect forward secrecy for rekeying (only if it was turned on in both endpoints) SA lifetime of 3600 seconds (one hour) with no kbytes rekeying Selectors for all IP protocols, all ports, between the two networks, using IPv4 subnets The IKE Phase 2 parameters supported by a standard edge are: TripleDES / AES (will match the Phase 1 setting) SHA-1 ESP tunnel mode MODP group 2 (1024 bits) Perfect forward secrecy for rekeying SA lifetime of 3600 seconds (one hour) with no kbytes rekeying Selectors for all IP protocols, all ports, between the two networks, using IPv4 subnets Configuring the edge gateway firewall When the VPN tunnel is up and running, you'll need to create firewall rules on the edge gateway for any traffic passing over the tunnel. For how to do this, see How to create firewall rules . Key points to note: You need to create a firewall rule for both directions, that is, from data centre to VDC and from VDC to data centre. For data centre to VDC, set: Source as the source IP range for your external VDC/data centre network Destination as the destination IP range for your VDC network For VDC to data centre, set: Source as the source IP range for your VDC network Destination as the destination IP range for your data centre/VDC network Configuring the external data centre gateway firewall When the VPN tunnel is up and running, you may need to create firewall rules and routes on your on-premises gateway or other internal firewall for traffic passing over the tunnel. This is outside of the scope of this article and will depend on your specific premises network configuration. Validating the tunnel When you've configured both ends of the IPSec tunnel, the connection should start without any issues. To verify the tunnel status in vCloud Director: In vCloud Director, click the Administration tab. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Double-click the virtual data centre (VDC) in which you set up your VPN, or right-click the VDC and select Open . Select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway and select Edge Gateway Services . For advanced gateways: Select the Statistics tab and then the IPsec VPN tab. For each configured tunnel, if you can see a tick, the tunnel is up and running and operational. If any other status is shown, you'll need to review your configuration and any firewall rules. For standard edges: - Select the **VPN** tab. - For each configured tunnel you should see an entry in the **Status** column. If it's a green tick, the tunnel is up and operational. If any other status is shown, you'll need to review your configuration and any firewall rules. Note It can take up to two minutes after the tunnel is established to show that the VPN connection is active. You should now be able to send traffic via the VPN. Note Logs from the vCNS IPsec VPN cannot currently be used to aid fault finding. Next steps In this article you've learned how to configure IPsec VPN.

    "title": "How to change IPsec VPN settings via the vCloud API | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to change IPsec VPN settings via the vCloud Director API Overview This guide shows you how to retrieve, modify, and submit blocks of XML that represent the configuration of the IPsec VPN tunnels. The guide covers modifications to the local and peer IP addresses, local and peer IDs as well the addition or removal of local and peer subnets. In addition to this, the guide also outlines the steps required to modify the shared secret key used on a given IPsec VPN tunnel. Use cases: Enabling customers to quickly amend IPsec configurations Modifications of this nature are not possible in the vCloud Director graphical user interface without first deleting the existing IPsec VPN configuration entirely and re-entering the settings. Depending on the number of tunnels, this can be a lengthy task. Making changes to the IPsec VPN configuration via the vCloud API can greatly speed up this process. Edge gateway configuration data You can also use the steps in this guide to obtain a backup of the current configuration applied to an edge gateway. You can then use this to restore the configuration of the edge gateway at a later point in time. By following the instructions in this guide you can make amendments to the IPsec VPN configuration without first needing to engage with UKCloud Support. Before you begin Before using the vCloud API to view and update IPsec VPN settings, we recommend that you install a REST client that enables you to access the API. The steps in this article use a Firefox plugin called RESTClient. For information about how to install this plugin, see How to install a REST client to access the vCloud API . You also need to find your API credentials. For more information, see How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API Obtaining an authorisation token To start interacting with the vCloud API, you first need to obtain an x-vcloud-authorization token; to do this you need to adjust some settings in RESTClient. In your browser, click the RESTClient icon. From the Method menu, select POST . In the API field, enter the API URL you recorded earlier and append the following to the end of the URL: /api/sessions Next add a Basic Authentication header. To do this, from the Authentication menu at the top of the REST Client, select Basic Authentication . In the Basic Authentication dialog box, in the Username field, enter your API username recorded earlier from the API page. In the Password field enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Okay . The Request section now includes an Authorization header. Next add an Accept header. To do this, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field, enter Accept In the Value field enter application/*+xml;version=5.5 and then click Okay . The Headers section should now be displayed, containing the Accept header. The RESTClient has now got all the required settings in place to make a request to the vCloud API to obtain a x-vcloud-authorization token, so click the Send button. When a response is received the Headers tab in the Response section will be populated, including an x-vcloud-authorization token. The x-vcloud-authorization token will replace the Basic Authentication header added earlier. To do this highlight and copy the string of characters displayed after the word x-vcloud-authorization . Note If at any point while following the instructions in this guide, the output displayed in the REST Client does not look similar to that shown in the images, you can use the value of the Status Code field to determine what went wrong and needs investigation. In this case above, Status Code received was HTTP 200 OK, which means that the request succeeded. For a list of HTTP response codes, see HTTP Response Codes . To add an x-vcloud-authorization header, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field enter x-vcloud-authorization . In the Value field, paste the string of characters copied in the previous step, then click Okay . Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can remove the Basic Authentication Header. Click the x in the upper right-hand corner of the header. ## Retrieving organisation details via the API Retrieving organisation details via the API Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can call the vCloud API to retrieve the information that you need about your organisation to set up your IPsec VPN. Set the Method to GET . In the Response section, select the Preview tab. This view lists the links that you can use to drill down into the various objects exposed via the vCloud API. Of interest in the output below is a link that will, when queried, return details about the organisation and the objects contained within it. The link should look something like: https://<api_url>/api/org/<org_id> Copy the URL and paste it into the Request URL field. Click Send . After a short amount of time the contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated to reflect the response from the vCloud API to your latest request, including links to each VDC in the organisation. Retrieving virtual data centre details via the API To retrieve details about the VDCs in an organisation: Copy the link for the VDC containing the target edge gateway for your IPsec VPN. The link should look something like: https>//<api_url>/api/vdc/<vdc_id> Click Send . The contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated again. Retrieving edge gateway configuration via the API To retrieve details of the edge gateway configuration: The response this time will probably be quite long. To easily locate a specific section in the response, use your browser's search utility. You can invoke this in Firefox by pressing CTRL+F . In the search dialog window at the bottom of the screen enter edgeGateways , and then click the down arrow button to locate a section that looks similar to the one shown below: <Link rel=\"edgeGateways\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/vdc/<vdc_id>/edgeGateways\" type=\"application/vnd.vmware.vcloud.query.records+xml\" /> Copy the link ending in /edgeGateways and paste it into the URL field at the top of the RESTClient. Ensure that the Method drop down is set to GET and click Send . If this request is successful, the response will contain a link to the edge gateway which, when queried, will return the configuration of the edge gateway. Once you have received a response, use your browser's search utility to locate the EdgeGatewayRecord section within the response. <EdgeGatewayRecord gatewayStatus=\"READY\" haStatus=\"UP\" isBusy=\"false\" name=\"UKCloud Gateway (nft00002i2)\" numberOfExtNetworks=\"1\" numberOfOrgNetworks=\"8\" vdc=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/vdc/<vdc_id>\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/edgeGateway/<edge_id>\" task=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/task/<task_id>\" isSyslogServerSettingInSync=\"true\" taskOperation=\"networkConfigureEdgeGatewayServices\" taskStatus=\"success\" taskDetails=\" \" /> Within the EdgeGatewayRecord section of the above from the response, locate the link to the edge gateway that starts with the following: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/ Appended to the end of the URL will be a unique identifier for the edge gateway within the VDC. Copy this link, paste it into the URL field and then click Send . After a short amount of time the current configuration of the edge gateway will be displayed in a block of XML. Reviewing the edge gateway configuration The edge configuration information is contained between an opening <Configuration> and closing </Configuration> tag. This block of XML is split into sections which detail the configuration settings applied to a specific item, function or service available on the edge gateway. There are twelve sections in total; however only the configuration settings contained under the <GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags will be discussed in this guide. The example below shows a high‑level overview of the structure of the XML block returned, including the <GatewayIpsecVpnServices> tags. <EdgeGateway> <Configuration> <GatewayBackingConfig> </GatewayBackingConfig> <GatewayInterfaces> </GatewayInterfaces> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <FirewallService> </FirewallService> <NatService> </NatService> <GatewayIpsecVpnService> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> <StaticRoutingService> </StaticRoutingService> <LoadBalancerService> </LoadBalancerService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <HaEnabled> </HaEnabled> <UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </Configuration> </EdgeGateway\\> Before making any changes to the edge gateway via the API it is highly recommended to keep a copy of the XML returned. You can then use this backup to restore the configuration of the edge gateway to a known working configuration if the need arises. To copy the XML: Select the Response Preview tab of the RESTClient. Scroll down to the opening <Configuration> tag and highlight everything up to and including the closing <\\Configuration> tag. The length of the XML to copy is dependent on the number of NAT, firewall rules and another configuration applied to the edge gateway. With the contents of the <Configuration> tags highlighted, right click and select Copy . Paste the configuration into a text editor, saving the file to a known location on your computer. Using a text editor that offers syntax highlighting such as Notepad++ will simplify the editing process. Locating the IPsec VPN settings in the returned XML To locate the IPsec VPN settings, open a new text editor window and copy and paste the contents between the opening <GatewayIpsecVpnService> and closing </GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags. The contents should look similar to the XML block shown below: <GatewayIpsecVpnService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <Endpoint> <Network type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.ukcloud.com/api/admin/network/3c284ec8-2850- ba77-098c-7f697a3d8769\"/> <PublicIp>37.26.88.73</PublicIp> </Endpoint> <Tunnel> <Name>UKCloud IPSEC VPN Demo</Name> <Description/> <IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> </IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerIpAddress>134.170.188.221</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> <LocalIpAddress>172.26.45.97</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>172.26.45.97</LocalId> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <SharedSecret>UKCloudIPSECVPNDemoSharedSecretKey</SharedSecret> <SharedSecretEncrypted>false</SharedSecretEncrypted> <EncryptionProtocol>AES256</EncryptionProtocol> <Mtu>1500</Mtu> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <IsOperational>true</IsOperational> </Tunnel> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> Modifying the IPsec VPN configuration This section outlines common tasks performed via the API to manipulate the IPsec VPN configuration applied to a given edge gateway. Modifying the local endpoint IP and local ID You can change the local IP and local ID by editing the contents between the opening <localIpAddress> and closing </localIpAddress> and <localId> and </localId> tags as shown below. Original <LocalIpAddress>172.26.45.97</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>172.26.45.97</LocalId> Modified <LocalIpAddress>37.26.88.73</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>37.26.88.73</LocalId> This is by far the most commonly performed modification to the IPsec VPN configuration via the vCloud API. You can use this to change the local IP address from the IP address assigned to the edge gateway on the transit network to the IP address assigned to the edge gateways on the public network. For the tunnel to come up successfully, the local IP address must be set to the edge gateway's public IP address. The local ID must also match the public IP address specified. Modifying the peer endpoint IP and peer ID If you need to move the remote endpoint of the tunnel to a new device or IP address, then you can adjust the following as required. Original <PeerIpAddress>134.170.188.221</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> Modified <PeerIpAddress>212.58.244.18</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>212.58.244.18</PeerId> When changing the peer IP address of the tunnel you must ensure that the peer ID is also updated to match the new peer IP address. Adding or removing local subnets You can add additional local subnets to the IPsec VPN tunnel. This involves adding a new local subnet definition to the IPsec VPN config. Original <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> Modified <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 2</Name> <Gateway>192.168.3.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> Adding or removing peer subnets You can use the same process to add or remove peer subnets Original <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> Modified <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.4.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.4.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> Amending the shared secret If you need to update or amend the shared secret on an IPsec VPN, edit the value between the opening <SharedSecret> and closing </SharedSecret> tags. Original <SharedSecret>UKCloudIPSECVPNDemoSharedSecretKey</SharedSecret> Modified <SharedSecret>4dae850771fbe3f06588b49772c0b8eb</SharedSecret> Note The shared secret must be at least 32 characters in length. To enhance the security of the tunnel, we highly recommend that you avoid using dictionary words in the shared secret key. Applying the new configuration When you've updated the relevant sections of the configuration, you can apply it to the edge gateway. Enclose the new configuration in a pair of <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> tags, as shown in the following example. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration xmlns=\"http://www.vmware.com/vcloud/v1.5\"> <GatewayIpsecVpnService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <Endpoint> <Network type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.ukcloud.com/api/admin/network/3c284ec8-2850- ba77-098c-7f697a3d8769\\\"/\\> <PublicIp>37.26.88.73</PublicIp> </Endpoint\\> <Tunnel\\> <Name>ukcloud IPSEC VPN Demo</Name> <Description/> <IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerId>212.58.244.18</PeerId> </IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerIpAddress>212.58.244.18</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>212.58.244.18</PeerId> <LocalIpAddress>37.26.88.73</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>37.26.88.73</LocalId> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet\\> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 2</Name> <Gateway>192.168.3.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <PeerSubnet\\> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.4.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.4.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <SharedSecret>4dae850771fbe3f06588b49772c0b8eb</SharedSecret> <SharedSecretEncrypted>false</SharedSecretEncrypted> <EncryptionProtocol>AES256</EncryptionProtocol> <Mtu>1500</Mtu> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <IsOperational>true</IsOperational> </Tunnel> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration\\>** Copy and paste this configuration into the Request Body section of the RESTClient. From the Method list, select POST . Append the following to the URL in the URL field: /action/configureServices For example, if the original contents of the URL were: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/48fbb9e-2e90-c055-aa46-86f18766f5b1 The updated URL would be: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/48fbb9e-2e90-c055-aa46-86f18766f5b1/action/configureServices You must also add one more Header to the RESTClient prior to submitting the new configuration. From the Headers menu at the top of the REST Client select Custom Header . In the Name field, enter Content-Type . In the Attribute Value field enter the following: application/vnd.vmware.admin.edgeGatewayServiceConfiguration+xml Click Okay . To submit the new configuration, click Send . The status of the edge gateway as viewed from vCloud Director will briefly show as Updating Configuration . Once this process has completed, right click the edge gateway and select Configure Services . In the Configure Services window select the VPN tab. You should see the new configuration settings. Verify the status of the IPsec VPN tunnel on your remote device to ensure that the tunnel has been established successfully.

    "keywords": "UKCloud for Oracle Software About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for Oracle software service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About UKCloud for Oracle Software The UKCloud for Oracle Software service provides a secure, scalable and cost-effective platform for hosting Oracle virtual machines (OVMs) of various sizes. You can use the platform to build new services quickly and securely; and migrate, augment or transform existing Oracle-based applications. The platform is immediately available so you can provision and scale OVMs in minutes. Service architecture Your UKCloud service architecture is as follows: Company. Your contract with UKCloud is associated with a company, which provides a single owner for the contract, regardless of how many accounts are created. Account. We use accounts to separate financial ownership. An account could represent an organisation, a customer contract, or a specific project. An account can also have several UKCloud services associated with it, such as UKCloud for Oracle, Cloud Storage and UKCloud for OpenStack. You can also use accounts to separate users based on access requirements or permissions. Organisation. This represents your UKCloud for Oracle Software service inside Oracle Enterprise Manager and on the UKCloud Portal. There is a 1:1 mapping of service to Organisation. Oracle Tenant. An Oracle Tenant is where you define your workload type and build your OVMs. You can create Oracle Tenants via a service request. Service configuration The UKCloud for Oracle Software infrastructure is uncontended and configured to optimise the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. There is only one service configuration on the UKCloud for Oracle Software platform, ensuring that OVMs are pinned to cores to stop OVM movement that would unbalance applications. Customers can self-configure OVMs by the number of cores, and amount of memory and storage needed. OVMs can be reconfigured to adjust resources in line with changing performance requirements. Self-service management is done through the Oracle Enterprise Management Portal, accessed through the UKCloud Portal. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition ( Assured | Elevated ). Storage options All storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Multiple storage options can be used to support different aspects of the application. Tier 1. Fast storage ideal for data warehouses, fast transactional databases or randomly executing workloads. Tier 2. General all-purpose storage, suitable for systems with human interactions or predictable work patterns. Cloud Storage. Ideal for serving media content or as a medium-term repository; can be used to store Recovery Manager (RMAN) backups. Storage policies We provide you with access to two storage policies: tier 1 and tier 2. We will initially provide you with a tier 2 storage policy, however you can request tier 1 storage be added to your Oracle Tenant so you can create additional disks with tier 1 storage on your OVMs. VM templates come with a 50GiB system disk and a secondary disk (equivalent to the size of the RAM associated with the OVM - up to 16GiB). These virtual disks are mapped from the tier 2 VM repository by default. For installations of Oracle apps on top of the OS, it's best to have separate non-OS virtual disks which are then mapped to mountpoints. The sizing requirements/recommendations for the non-OS storage can be found on the official Oracle installation guides and they can differ from version to version. You'll need to take into consideration future data growth while planning capacity, as this would also reflect on the capacity required for backups. We do not guarantee storage performance, as it can be affected by many factors. We do not provide IOPS figures for our storage offerings. Workloads can use multiple storage profiles. Protection UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include any infrastructure-level backup or disaster recovery functionality. However, the underpinning infrastructure supports native Oracle protection technologies such as Data Guard and RMAN. UKCloud's Cloud Storage can be used as an S3-addressable target for Oracle protection technologies. Service availability UKCloud for Oracle Software offers an SLA guarantee of 99.95% availability. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of the SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition document. Our SLA does not cover faults within your control, such as client application issues, or faults within external connectivity providers (for example, internet, PSN or N3/HSCN). Service background UKCloud for Oracle Software is underpinned by Oracle compute infrastructure. UKCloud manage the physical infrastructure and utilise our partner, Infomentum, to provide support and management from the hypervisor level and above. Infomentum will provision your Oracle Tenant environment and UKCloud will present it to you through the Oracle Enterprise Manager. You will be responsible for OVM creation and maintenance. All service requests will be triaged by UKCloud. We reserve the right to escalate a request to Infomentum for support. If you have not have a managed service contract with Infomentum, please do not contact them directly. UKCloud actively capacity-manages the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned, and we will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Internally this includes, but isn't limited to, the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager and Oracle Virtual Machine Server versions, and the hardware version of the platform. Externally this includes the available versions of the edge gateway and Oracle Enterprise Manager. You can make additional configurations inside an OVM (such as implementing third-party software technologies). We do not support customer implementations inside a VM. Operating systems UKCloud for Oracle Software includes the base OVM platform licences, which provide VM containers that meet Oracle's definition of hard partitioning. Our service does not include licences for the Oracle applications and databases you choose to run. As the underlying platform is powered by OVM technology, you can either transfer your existing licences, or purchase new licences based on the quantity of virtual processors (cores) you allocate within each VM. Please note that UKCloud does not have the functionality to provide Oracle licensing, and this must be sourced via an appropriate partner. 'Cores' refers to OVM vCPUs pinned to physical processor cores (excluding hyper-threading). Your Oracle licensing will be based on the cores consumed by your OVM. Update services. We make update repositories available for OVM containers. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software, including all Oracle applications. Anti-virus. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks Internet-facing solutions. You are provided with 2 usable public IP addresses, but you can ask for additional public IP addresses via a Service Request. We reserve the right to decline the request if you have spare capacity in your existing deployment. PSN-facing solutions. You should raise a Service Request or contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to be assigned your IP address. This solution also comes with contended bandwidth (uncapped). Janet and N3/HSCN solutions. You have one usable IP address, but you can request additional IP addresses via a Service Request. UKCloud for Oracle Software does not have a native external connectivity functionality. Therefore, UKCloud have enabled customers to manage connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through a VMware edge gateway. This edge is provisioned within the UKCloud for VMware environment and is managed using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. This edge can be an existing edge in a customer's UKCloud for VMware environment, or can be provisioned as a completely new entity, specific for Oracle. Edge gateway By default, we assign one edge gateway per connectivity type. You can choose which external network you would like to enable your Oracle environment to connect to. Note that the Oracle environment does not have to connect to an external network, however an external network will need to be connected to the edge. Site-to-site IPsec VPN. You can create IPsec VPN tunnels to connect different environments, both internal and external, to UKCloud. There is a limit of 64 tunnels per edge gateway. Bring Your Own Firewall Bring Your Own Firewall is currently not available for UKCloud for Oracle Software installations; however, you can have BYOF within UKCloud for VMware and connect it to the UKCloud for Oracle Software edge gateway via an IPsec VPN. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the hypervisor level and below. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM). Components above this infrastructure are your own responsibility to provide an appropriate protective monitoring capability. In line with UKCloud's System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP), we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the UKCloud for Oracle Software service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: Oracle Enterprise Manager. The graphical interface for the creation and management of the Oracle environment. vCloud Director API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of the Oracle edge gateway. vCloud Director graphical UI. Provides a graphical interface to access the vCloud Director environment to manage the Oracle edge gateway (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Enables the creation of Oracle compute services and edge gateways. The Portal also includes an overview of actual and estimated spend, along with service configuration information. Access to service reporting and incident and request management is also possible through the Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager environment. Service migration UKCloud do not currently provide migration services, however customers are free to bring their own migration tools and utilise them within the UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. Service reporting Visibility. We provide a monthly service report via the UKCloud Portal. This includes a summary of platform availability and a retrospective of the interactions with UKCloud support during the previous month. Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are also delivered through the portal. Service reporting. All service reporting is done via the UKCloud Portal. Billing. Billing is issued on a monthly basis where you will be billed for your total monthly consumption. Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud CSM who will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud UKCloud for Oracle Software service. This includes finding relevant systems and how to use UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing Oracle solutions. Technical Account Managers (TAM). You will be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities You are responsible for assessing whether the UKCloud UKCloud for Oracle Software platform can support the various requirements of your application. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (N3/HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), you are responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided. Management and administration of layers above the Oracle hypervisor (OS patching, application performance monitoring, user administration). You are also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud SISP and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 4 hours of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a welcome pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. UKCloud and Infomentum will provision the Oracle Tenant environment. UKCloud will request information such as private subnets before creating the environment. Once the build is complete, UKCloud will provide you with access to provision Oracle virtual machines and Oracle networks. UKCloud has created several videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the UKCloud Knowledge Centre . In addition, you will be assigned a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to provide any assistance required during the first 90 days of the service. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs. Service constraints UKCloud will adhere to the following in terms of maintenance windows: \"Planned Maintenance\" means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, if you will be affected then UKCloud shall provide you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the Planned Maintenance. If during Planned Maintenance there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the planned maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. For OVMs, this time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service. \"Emergency Maintenance\" means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure relating to the service. Whenever possible, UKCloud will: a) provide affected customers with at least six (6) hours' advanced notice and; b) carry out the emergency maintenance between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Friday or between the hours of Saturday 00:00 to 06:00 (UK local time) on Monday, (including bank holidays) unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to customer environment(s). Emergency Maintenance may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. If during Emergency Maintenance there is a loss of availability to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. This time will be excluded from the availability calculation but will be included in monthly service reporting related to the service.

    "keywords": "VM compatibility with UKCloud for Oracle Software Introduction This article outlines what you need to do to make sure your Oracle VMs (OVMs) are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software service. You may find this useful if you're moving VMs from UKCloud for VMware to UKCloud for Oracle Software. OVF and VMDK OVF and VMDK files are not compatible with Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM), the management plane that's used to deploy and manage your UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. To make sure your VMs are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software you may need to transform your VMs. OVA files (Assembly option) and tar.gz/tgz (Template option) are the only accepted file formats. OVA If you select the Assembly option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an OVA Assembly package file ( ova file). Your .ova file should contain the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .ovf - the OVF descriptor file, which contains all VM specs metadata and links to the embedded virtual disk image file (with a .vmdk extension) MyVM .mf - contains metadata that is used for integrity and authenticity checks; this data must be correct for the .ova file to be accepted in most cases MyVM .vmdk - the embedded virtual disk image file As the exported .ova file also contains file hashes that are unique to the files included in the package, simply creating a tar file with these contents will not work in most cases. For most virtualisation platforms, it's best to use the export functionality from the source virtualisation platform to generate the .ova file. One way of converting your VMs to an .ova file would be to use the OVF Tool, for example: ovftool \"original.ovf\" \"original.ova\" Tip Make sure you include the quotation marks ( \" ). You can download the OVF Tool from: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL400&productId=353 TAR If you select the Template option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an Oracle VM Template file (either a .tgz or .tar.gz file). This gzipped tarball file normally contains the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .cfg - contains the VM specs metadata and links to the embedded RAW disk image file, normally named system.img system.img - the embedded RAW disk image file, either exported from another XEN platform or converted from other virtual disk formats Upload size For any uploads larger than 500 MB, you'll need to allow sufficient time for the upload to complete before clicking the Upload button or it will fail and the item will not appear in your software library. There is currently no upload progress indicator on OEM. Oracle is aware of this but are treating it as an enhancement request therefore there's currently no indication of when the upload progress indicator will be added on future releases of the platform software.

    "title": "Oracle licensing on the UKCloud platform | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Oracle licensing on the UKCloud platform Overview Due to the licensing rules regarding Oracle, it is not possible to install and run Oracle software on the UKCloud public cloud platform. However, there are currently two ways for customers to install and run Oracle software with UKCloud: Private Cloud for Compute . This is a dedicated hardware solution that limits the number of cores, RAM and storage that would require Oracle licensing. Note that this may not be financially efficient for all customers, and this will be a bare metal environment that has not been prepared for Oracle. UKCloud for Oracle Software . This is a solution specifically designed to host Oracle solutions on a separate platform. This enables Oracle licensing to be used correctly, and is also financially efficient. The remainder of this article is regarding general Oracle licensing. Important Licensing rules from vendors such as Oracle can change frequently and so customers should validate their specific requirement with Oracle at the time of ordering. This information is correct as of June 2015. For customers wishing to licence Oracle software on virtual machines within the UKCloud platform, there are some important issues to consider with regards to the four licensing options available which are described below. Named User By implementing this licensing option, the customer can run as many Oracle servers as they want for a fixed fee ‘per named user’. As this licence model is independent of the size or number of servers, it is preferable for use in multi-tenant cloud environments such as the UKCloud platform. UKCloud appreciate that this solution may not be valid for customers that already have ‘per processor” licensing. Per Processor This type of licence allows the customer to have as many users as they need for a fixed cost ‘per processor’ that the servers run on. In a traditional physical or virtualised estate, it is possible to isolate a small subset of the overall physical servers to specifically run Oracle. In this way, only those specific servers need to be licensed for Oracle. In most multi-tenant cloud environments such as the UKCloud platform, the per processor virtual machines can run on any physical server and so, practically, Oracle requires all of those servers to be licensed – which is simply not cost effective. Oracle software within a cloud based environment can also be licensed via the per-processor option if the cloud environment is running Oracle Virtual Machine (OVM) as the hypervisor. However, due to the design of the cloud environment, this is not something UKCloud can provide or support. Oracle has negotiated an agreement with a few public cloud providers (at the time of writing, only Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure) to allow customers to license only specific host servers, but this is not yet a widely available licensing agreement. Dedicated Compute platform Customers can take advantage of the 'per processor' licensing model, by using the UKCloud Dedicated Compute platform which will provide the customer with a set hardware configuration. The Dedicated Compute option enables a customer to specify a dedicated hardware cluster of a certain number of physical servers, and this option can help customers who need more certainty as to the configuration and capacity of the cluster which underpins part of their application, whilst being also able to accommodate the compromises of having a dedicated cluster with regards to reduced levels of agility and flexibility. Application Specific Full Use Licensing An Application Specific Full Use (ASFU) licence is a restricted type of licence sold by a Solution Provider in conjunction with its third-party Application Package. For example, you can buy an ASFU licence from SAP AG to use Oracle with the SAP/R3 system. This licence would then be application specific and cannot be used for anything else. Embedded Software License An Embedded Software License (ESL) is a very restrictive licence type available from Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) who embed Oracle technology into their product. An end-user may not even be aware that the software package contains Oracle technology and should not be able to access it directly as a developer or system administrator. An example of this licensing model in use may be a Point of Sale system that requires a database to log transactions. Note The ASFU and ESL licensing options are outside the scope of UKCloud control.

This Getting Started Guide provides an overview of the functionality available with UKCloud for Oracle Software. Intended audience This guide is intended for customers who want to get up and running with UKCloud for Oracle Software. Introduction to UKCloud for Oracle Software Many applications running in the UK public sector today have a backbone powered by Oracle software. They include ERP solutions, finance systems (such as payroll), HR systems and wide variety of citizen‑supporting applications. Oracle solutions have traditionally been subject to licensing and technical requirements that have made it challenging to carry out cloud transition projects and meet the government's Cloud First policy. UKCloud for Oracle Software enables you to start your cloud journey with your Oracle applications. It overcomes the licensing and technical barriers, and provides the trusted, connected and flexible Assured OFFICIAL and non-internet-connected Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platforms you need to deliver your critical Oracle applications in the cloud. UKCloud for Oracle Software can help you achieve the business goals at the centre of your strategy, without risking your operational ability to execute. The service has been designed and tested for compatibility with the most popular Oracle applications used in citizen‑facing solutions today, including: Oracle database (including features such as encryption and Data Guard) Oracle WebLogic Server Oracle Fusion Applications Oracle Enterprise Manager Oracle E-Business Suite UKCloud for Oracle Software provides workloads with an uncontended infrastructure optimised for the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. You can right‑size the allocated resources to suit the changing demands of your application; ensuring performance and avoiding over‑capacity. You can specify the resource allocation of each workload independently: simply choose the appropriate CPU cores, amount of memory and required storage from the catalogue. The service offers the following technical benefits specific to Oracle workloads: Use of core-pinning technology means that Oracle workloads operating on the UKCloud platform aren't subject to the types of movement that can unbalance Oracle applications running on other cloud platforms The scalable nature of our service enables you to add or remove cores in line with your understanding of the performance requirements of your solution Self-service management of your environment via our Customer Portal, which you can also use to programmatically control your Oracle environment Virtual firewalls to manage connectivity into and out of your environment -- self-service and free of charge IPsec and SSL VPN/SDN to create secure connections between users and other environments using a variety of included tunnelling technologies Basic load balancing to configure active/active solutions that are resilient to outages and can handle high levels of activity, using our on‑platform, out‑of‑the‑box load balancers Persistent storage so that your data remains, even when a virtual machine (VM) is turned off, ensuring that your application data remains consistent and available Oracle licensing compliance UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include Oracle licensing but, because the platform is powered by OVM technology, you can be assured that it is compliant with Oracle's licensing requirements and you can bring your own Oracle licensing to build your solutions. UKCloud ensures that hard partitioning is in place in all customer guest VMs in order to conform to Oracle licensing policies. When you create or modify a VM, automatic CPU pinning ensures that the VM won't use any CPUs other than the ones specifically pinned to the VM's vCPUs. If you have any questions about Oracle licensing, contact your Cloud Architect, Customer Success Manager or Technical Account Manager. If you require assistance building out your Oracle solution, we can put you in contact with one or our partners who specialises in Oracle technologies. Your UKCloud for Oracle Software estate The management of your Oracle estate is split between Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) and vCloud Director: Use OEM to build and manage your VMs and templates Use vCloud Director to create your VM networks and configure your edge gateway, including firewall rules and VPN connections When you first purchase UKCloud for Oracle Software, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) creates an Oracle tenant to act as a top‑level container for your Oracle VMs. As your estate grows, you can add more tenants to logically organise your resources. Within your Oracle tenant you can create the VMs that comprise your Oracle applications. Before you begin You should have received your OEM login credentials, including the URL for OEM Cloud Control.

Building virtual machines Your Oracle applications will consist of one or more VMs. In the Cloud Console, you create a VM by requesting a server. You can base your VMs on assemblies or templates. On the Infrastructure -- Oracle VM Cloud Services page you can view and manage all your Oracle VMs. More information! How to build an Oracle virtual machine Setting up your network Before you can start using the VMs in your Oracle environment, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other, and potentially also to the outside world. This network enables your VMs to communicate with each other or access external networks. A single Oracle tenant can have multiple networks. When UKCloud sets up a new Oracle tenant for you, we'll usually create an edge gateway for that tenant, but the creation of any networks is your responsibility. Networking and connectivity for UKCloud for Oracle Software is managed within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Note Because you create your network in vCloud Director, you'll see references to VMware terminology, such as organisations and virtual data centres (VDCs). In UKCloud for Oracle Software, an Oracle tenant is equivalent to a VDC. There are two types of network: An isolated (internally connected) network provides access only to the VMs within the Oracle tenant (see How to create an isolated VDC network ). A routed (externally connected) network provides access to machines and networks outside the Oracle tenant via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per tenant: one for each connectivity type (see How to create a routed VDC network ). Configuring your edge gateway An edge gateway controls how traffic from the outside world comes into and out of your environment. It is very important to make sure that your edge gateway is configured correctly to make your applications available but also secure. The tools for configuring your edge gateway are provided within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Your edge gateway provides the following services: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) --- The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to VDC networks connected to an edge (see How to create a DHCP pool ). Network address translation (NAT) --- NAT rules determine where to direct inbound and outbound traffic (see How to create NAT rules ). Firewall --- The firewall controls which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway (see How to create firewall rules ). Static routing --- Provides static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example, networks in other VDCs in your compute service (see How to create a static route ). VPN --- IPsec site-to-site VPN is available on the edge gateway (see How to configure IPsec VPN ). Load balancing --- The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin (see How to configure a load balancer ). Logging out of the Cloud Control console When you're done working in the Cloud Control console, we recommend that you log out to prevent unauthorised access. To log out of the Cloud Control console, click your user name and select Log Out . Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned the basics about UKCloud for Oracle Software.

This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the public sector: from PSN Protected to N3/HSCN and RLI. This article provides an introduction to UKCloud for Microsoft Azure and helps you get up and running. Supported features UKCloud for Microsoft Azure supports the following Azure Stack IaaS features: Compute Virtual machines (VMs) provide the basic building block providing compute in Azure Stack. For a list of available VM sizes, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-sizes . You can deploy VMs using the Azure Stack portal and other tooling. VMs have the following support: API Azure Stack Marketplace - Provides access to pre-created images that help speed up application delivery Azure Resource Manager - Enables you to write templates to deploy, update and delete Azure Stack resources in a single co-ordinated operation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-considerations Network Virtual networks - Azure Stack enables you to configure virtual private clouds, create and manage your private address space within Azure; you can configure this via the UI, API and other tooling Load balancers (IPv4 only) — You can deploy basic load balancers VPN gateway — You can use the Azure Stack VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure Routing — You can configure basic custom defined routing on virtual networks; Vnet to Vnet peering is not yet supported https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-network-differences Storage Type of storage Description Notes vs Azure Azure Blob Storage (block) Object storage; good for storing documents, videos, images and so on Size of disk storage differs significantly, as well as naming standards like name length Azure Blob Storage (page) Used to support virtual machine disks; good for randomly accessed large files Azure Blob Storage (append) Used for log files Azure Queue Storage Message queue as a service to provide asynchronous scale out micro-services, among other things Azure Table Storage NoSQL database service; good for highly scalable, eventually consistent database support Max sizes differ Advanced features Key Vault — Azure Stack provides cryptographic secret storage for applications and services. These services can be consumed by both portal and API. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kv-intro Design considerations When designing your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure applications, consider the following: Compute Azure Stack supports a subset of Azure VM extensions; UKCloud for Microsoft Azure currently supports the following: BGInfo v2.1 CustomScriptExtension v1.8 JsonADDomainExtension v1.3 VMAccessAgent v2 CustomScriptForLinux v1.5.2.0 OSPatchingForLinux v2.3.0.1 VMAccessForLinux v1.4.0.0 DockerExtension v1.1.1606092330 DSC v2.19.0.0 IaaSAntimalware v1.4.0.0 IaaSDiagnostics v1.10.1.1 MicrosoftMonitoringAgent v1.0.10900.0 For an up-to-date list of the supported extensions, perform the following steps: First, ensure that you've installed the relevant Azure PowerShell tools from the following links: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-powershell-install https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-powershell-download Then run the following commands: Add-AzureRMEnvironment -Name \"AzureStackAdmin\" -ArmEndpoint \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" Login-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName \"AzureStackAdmin\" Get-AzureRmVmImagePublisher -Location frn00006 | ` Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImageType | ` Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImage | ` Select Type, Version | ` Format-Table -Property * -AutoSize Use load balancers to make the best use of IP address quota Azure Stack API may be a couple of releases behind Azure Single region and single state set (affects availability) VM sets don't support auto-scale, so consider how to handle load Check Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to see if they're compatible with Azure Stack Storage Azure Stack storage is all served from the same pool of disks and does not provide “limitless” storage, so you should consider the following: Use blob storage (object storage) to support the application; not for multiple petabytes of data storage Put large volume data on UKCloud's Cloud Storage Clean up backups to conserve storage Consider use of temporary storage There is a difference in maximum blob storage between Azure and Azure Stack No guarantees around IOPs Use blob storage for queues to help deliver scalable micro-services Accessing UKCloud for Microsoft Azure You can access UKCloud for Microsoft Azure from the following location: https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/ Further information For more information about Azure Stack, see the following Microsoft resources: Get Started with Azure Azure Stack Operator Documentation For more information about UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, see: Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure UKCloud for Microsoft Azure FAQs Feedback If you have any comments on this article, or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

It will guide you through the creation of: an Azure application a Service Principal Name role assignment permissions What is a Service Principal Name? An Azure Service Principal Name (SPN) is a security identity used by user-created applications, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a 'user identity' (username and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions. It only needs to be able to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you grant it only the minimum permissions level needed to perform its management tasks. To log in and manage your resources via SPN you'll need to create an Azure application and then assign SPN to it. Only then will you be able to perform tasks against your environment. Prerequisites Azure CLI Configure Azure CLI Environment for Azure Stack Active Azure Subscription (required to create SPN if you want to use the same SPN for both Azure and Azure Stack) Official Documentation Service Principal Name commands for 2017-03-09-profile Create an Azure Service Principal Name with Azure CLI 2.0 for 2017-03-09-profile Important Currently Azure CLI 2.0.41 is broken and this will NOT work - see GitHub Issue The workaround is to use older Azure CLI How To Install Azure CLI on CentOS CentOS Azure CLI Packages yum install azure-cli-2.0.25-1.el7.x86_64 -y How To Install Azure CLI on Windows Windows Azure CLI MSI Package Overview of the creation process for Azure Stack SPN Prepare your Azure Stack environment - Configure Azure CLI Environment for Azure Stack Create your Azure Stack environment. Log in to your Azure Stack Subscription with administrator user credentials (needs to have Owner role). Create Azure Application, Service Principal Name, and Assign Role Note Unlike with PowerShell - Azure CLI creates an Azure Application, creates Service Principal Name (SPN) and assigns Roles to Service Principal Name (SPN) in one command. Log in to your Azure Stack Subscription using the SPN account. Create a new resource group using the SPN account in Azure Stack. Remove the resource group you just created from Azure Stack. Create Service Principal Name (SPN) for Azure Stack with Set Password # Set Azure Stack Environment az cloud set --n AzureStackUser # Log in to Azure Stack using your Administrator account az login -u <username>@<tenantDomain> -p <password> # Create Service Principal Name az ad sp create-for-rbac --name \"ServicePrincipalName\" --password 'Password1234!' --role=\"Owner\" # This command will output five values # { # \"appId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\", # \"displayName\": \"azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15\", # \"name\": \"http://azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15\", # \"password\": \"Password1234!\", # \"tenant\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\" # } # Log in to Azure Stack using Service Principal Name (SPN) ## Note, CLIENT_ID=appId, CLIENT_SECRET=password, TENANT_ID=tenant az login --service-principal -u CLIENT_ID -p CLIENT_SECRET --tenant TENANT_ID # Test your SPN account by creating a new Resource Group in Azure Stack az group create --name rg01 --location frn00006 # Remove test Resource Group az group delete --name rg01 -y Note Arguments for Service Principal Login can be derived from the output of its creation: CLIENT_ID=appId CLIENT_SECRET=password TENANT_ID=tenant Tip You can also run the create-for-rbac command without password and then you can pick the automatically generated password from the output variable: az ad sp create-for-rbac --name \"ServicePrincipalName\" --role=\"Owner\" { \"appId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\", \"displayName\": \"azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15\", \"name\": \"http://azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15\", \"password\": \"0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\", \"tenant\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\" } This is yet another difference between PowerShell creation as there is no auto-generation of passwords built-in"

    "keywords": "How to use the VMware OVF Tool Overview The VMware OVF Tool is a conversion program freely downloadable from VMware that assists in the distribution of virtual machines (VMs) and vApps, converting them between OVF, VMX and OVA formats. It also includes a command‑line facility to import and export OVF packages between environments or from third party suppliers. The OVF Tool is a command‑line interface (CLI) tool only. OVF (Open Virtualisation Format) is a packaging standard created by leading virtualisation vendors. It is a platform independent, efficient, open packaging and distribution format for virtual machines. VMX (the VM configuration file) is a simple text file with various parameters relating to the guest Virtual Machine. The OVA file extension is associated with Open Virtual Machine Format. Compared to the OVF file format, the OVA format contains all VM files and *.ovf files compressed into one single OVA archive file instead of many files in a folder. Downloading the OVF Tool You can download the OVF Tool via the following link: https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL420&productId=491 You must have a VMware account to download the tool. You can download the OVF Tool for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit, Linux 32-bit and 64-bit, or Mac OS X. After downloading and installing the OVF Tool, you must then go to the directory in which you installed the tool to run it. There is no icon or program logo on your desktop for the OVF Tool, so to launch it, you must use the command prompt. Go to the installation folder and run: ovftool Getting started with the OVF Tool The OVF Tool is a CLI tool, so some level of familiarity with CMD commands helps in using the tool. There are a number of help commands, which are a good source of information: ovftool --help ovftool --help examples ovftool --help locators ovftool --help config You can also find the OVF Tool User Guide at: https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/ Basic import and export commands You'll mainly use the OVF Tool to import (deploy) and export VMs or appliances into and out of your UKCloud environment. The basic syntax to do this using the OVF Tool is: ovftool <source> <target> Refer to the OVF Tool User Guide for further commands and switches. Importing a .vmx file to a vApp template in vCloud Director To import a .vmx file: In your UKCloud environment, create a catalogue to contain the vApp template. Make sure you are in the correct directory, that is, the directory containing the file you want to import. Run the following command: ovftool --vCloudTemplate --acceptAllEulas --overwrite <filename> \"vcloud://<username>@<apiURL>?org=<computeServiceID>&vappTemplate=<newTemplate>&catalog=<catalogID>\" Where: vCloudTemplate indicates that you're uploading a new vApp template acceptAllEulas indicates that you accept all end user licence agreements overwrite indicates that you're replacing an existing vApp with the new one being uploaded filename is the name of the .vmx file that are importing username is your UKCloud Portal user ID apiURL is your vCloud Director API URL. This URL is different depending on the region in which your environment is located. For more information, see How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API . computeServiceID is the ID of your UKCloud compute service (sometimes also called an org or vOrg) vappTemplate is the ID of the vApp template catalogID is the ID of the catalog in which the vApp template is located For example: ovftool --vCloudTemplate --acceptAllEulas --overwrite centos71.vmx \"vcloud://auser@api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com:443?org=1-2-3-a4b56c& vappTemplate=centos71&catalog=OVFTool-test\" Tip Make sure you use double quotes ( \" ) rather than single quotes ( ' ).

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection Overview Journaling Protection is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can help you improve your organisational resilience. By adopting UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution, you can protect your UKCloud for VMware applications by replicating them to another UKCloud for VMware‑enabled zone. This ensures that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements --- including any aggressive recovery point or recovery time objectives. Our Journaling Protection solution is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. This guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Journaling Protection up and running in your environment. Intended audience This guide is intended for any user who needs to create and manage Journaling Protection for UKCloud for VMware. To complete the steps in this guide you need to have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Introduction to Journaling Protection You can protect your VMs by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. When you add Journaling Protection to a vApp, if a VM in that vApp is compromised, for example by a virus attack or bad software update, you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before that attack or update took place. You enable Journaling Protection by adding the vApp to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the recovery site and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the source site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the recovery site and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for a specified number of days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a virus, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the attack. During recovery, the vApp and its VMs are created on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Two terms you may hear in connection with Journaling Protection are recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO). The RPO indicates the amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of an outage. For example, if your application data changes fairly infrequently, your RPO can be higher as the data remains fairly static. However, if your application data is constantly changing, you'll need your RPO to be smaller to avoid significant loss of data in the event of an outage. The RTO is the amount of time you can tolerate your application being unavailable in the event of an outage. For example, if your application provides critical functionality, you'll need to bring it back online very quickly. However, for a less critical application, you may be able to tolerate a longer outage. Because of the use of regular checkpoints (every few seconds), our Zerto‑powered Journaling Protection option provides a minimal RPO. The ability to use recovered VMs even before all the journal data has been promoted provides a good RTO as well. Before you begin When you request Journaling Protection for your VMs, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP), where you can create and manage your VPGs You should consider the following: Journaling Protection is provided on a vApp basis (not for individual VMs). When designing your application, you should use vApps to group related VMs together to ensure crash consistency between VMs in the event of a failover. VMs must be powered on to be synchronised. The operating system used by the protected VMs must also be supported in the recovery site. Our Journaling Protection service option captures every action. When a VM is deleted from your vApp, the associated journal is also deleted. If you want to keep historic records of VMs that are no longer running on the platform, consider UKCloud's Snapshot Protection service option. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the Journaling Protection Service Scope . We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles. Getting Journaling Protection up and running To get Journaling Protection up and running for your VMs, follow the steps below: Create a recovery VDC Configure networking on the recovery site Create a virtual protection group Perform a test failover Create a recovery VDC To recover your VMs to a different UKCloud site, you must have a VDC in the intended recovery site. If you already have a compute service in the recovery site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the recovery site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Journaling Protection Service Request. Configure networking on the recovery site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your recovery site to duplicate those in the source site. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ). In the event of a failover, external access to the recovery site will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware cloud, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. You do not need to configure vApp networks in advance as they will be replicated within the VPG. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for protection purposes. The UKCloud Journaling Protection service option protects VMs on a vApp basis. When you create a VPG, you specify the vApp to protect and all the VMs in that vApp are protected. For example, in a standard three-tier application, you will likely have three VMs: one for your application, one for the database and one for the web server. As best practice, you should create these three related VMs in a single vApp, which you can then add to a VPG so that all the VMs are replicated (and recovered) together. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Perform a test failover After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test failover to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly in the event of a live failover. You should also run test failovers periodically to ensure that your VMs can still be recovered successfully. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Next steps You have now performed all the steps needed to set up Journaling Protection for your VMs. If you experience a disaster, such as a virus attack, you can perform a live failover to recover your VMs to a specific point in time before the disaster occurred and continue operation as usual. For more information, see How to perform a failover .

    "keywords": "How to access UKCloud services from Walled Garden and Secure Remote Access Overview If you've implemented either Secure Remote Access (SRA) or a Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) Walled Garden solution and want to access UKCloud services (such as WSUS, KMS or Red Hat Update Service), you'll need to edit your edge gateway settings to enable access. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have vCloud Director administrator access to a virtual data centre (VDC) in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain. Before you begin Before making network changes to your environment, you'll need the following information: The Transit IP for the Elevated edge gateway of your CDSZ or SRA VDC The Transit IP for the edge gateway of your Elevated VDC The IP of the service you require. To get the last two octets of the IP addresses for the service you require, please raise a support ticket on the UKCloud Elevated Portal. Setting up access to UKCloud services The diagrams below show that you need to add two static routes and an SNAT rule on two edge gateways. In vCloud Director, locate the edge gateway that is attached to the Elevated side in your CDSZ or SRA VDC. Create a static route that directs traffic for the service you need via the Transit IP of your Elevated edge gateway. For more detailed instructions, see How to create a static route . Create an SNAT rule on your Elevated VDC to allow the private IP range from your CDSZ or SRA to have external access. For more detailed instructions, see How to create NAT rules . Amend the firewall to allow the private IP range access to the service you require on your Elevated VDC. For more detailed instructions, see How to create firewall rules Add a static route for the return traffic on your Elevated VDC to point to the Transit IP of your CDSZ or SRA VDC. Next steps Now that you've set up access to UKCloud services, you can register your VMs with those services. For more information, see: How to license Windows VMs using the UKCloud Key Management Server How to connect to the UKCloud Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) How to install Red Hat Update Infrastructure on an existing virtual machine Feedback If you have any comments on this document or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

    "title": "Cross Domain Security Zone FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Cross Domain Security Zone FAQs Service What is the service? The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables customers to transfer data securely between the UKCloud Assured OFFICIAL (formerly IL2) cloud platform and the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL (formerly IL3) cloud platform using CESG-approved cross-domain security patterns. This allows solutions hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform that are citizen facing to be accessed securely from the internet. Two service options are available to enable use of the CDSZ: UKCloud Guard Walled Garden Do I have to buy other UKCloud services to use services in the CDSZ? Yes. UKCloud cross-domain services are available only to customers purchasing other UKCloud services, such as IaaS (compute and storage) or PaaS (UKCloud for OpenShift). Is there a free trial available for either service option? The complex assurance requirements mean that trials aren't available. What is the process for applying for a service in the CDSZ? You can find the information you need in the UKCloud Knowledge Centre, including a detailed description of the assurance process. How do I enable access from the internet to my solution hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform? For citizen-facing solutions hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform that need to be accessible from the internet, you can use the UKCloud Guard, or build your own solution using the Walled Garden. If you use the UKCloud Guard, you'll need to deploy additional web servers on the Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform to perform pre-authentication, validation checking and initial anti-virus. The web servers can then communicate with your application server hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform via HTTP web services through the UKCloud Guard. Use of the UKCloud Guard is subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. With the Walled Garden, you can create your own inspection, anti-malware and security services in the CDSZ between the internet-facing components on the Assured OFFICIAL cloud platform and the higher-security components hosted on the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform. Use of a self-managed Walled garden is subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. Direct connectivity into the UKCloud Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform via the internet is possible using a CAPS-approved VPN solution using government-grade encryption products (for example, Kryptor). CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) VPN solutions may be used subject to approval by the UKCloud SIRO. UKCloud can host the IPsec VPN gateway device within the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform, but procurement, configuration and ongoing management of the solution are your responsibility. UKCloud also offers Secure Remote Access, a CPA-approved VPN solution that allows access to the Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platform via a self-managed walled garden within the CDSZ. For more information, see the UKCloud Secure Remote Access service description on the Digital Marketplace. Are there any bandwidth limitations for traffic traversing the walled garden firewalls in and out of the CDSZ? Yes, there is a 1GB throughput limitation to the CDSZ in both Farnborough and Corsham. Is there storage capacity on CDSZ virtual machines (VMs)? The storage capacity of a VM in the CDSZ is 60GB. UKCloud cannot provide additional storage in the CDSZ for designs involving patch repositories. We advise customers to engage a UKCloud solutions architect to create a design that allows use of storage on the Assured or the Elevated platform. What information do I need to include in my application for a service in the CDSZ? As a minimum the application must include: A business case explaining why a cross-domain solution is required The technical architecture of the solution - incorporating either the UKCloud Guard or your proposed Walled Garden solution An assurance plan - your proposed approach to ensuring that risks are correctly identified, appropriate mitigation is implemented and residual risks are accepted, so that both the UKCloud and customer SIROs can make an informed decision about the risks of the solution UKCloud Guard What is the UKCloud Guard? UKCloud provides a secure and scalable Guard which supports structured and inspectable HTTP-based data flows. This service offers an immediately available (subject to the assurance process) multi-tenant Guard to support simple use cases. What data can the UKCloud Guard inspect? It can inspect structured and inspectable HTTP-based data such as XML and JSON. Does UKCloud support JSON and are there any 'rules' around it? Both guards (IWSVA and Deep Secure) can currently pass through JSON content. This is currently based on both products recognising the content as text. Can I change the data that's allowed to flow through the UKCloud Guard? No. Any changes to what is and isn't allowed through the guard will be decided at a service level by UKCloud. If you need a different solution, we recommend you use the Walled Garden. Can I design a redundant UKCloud Guard? Yes. You can implement a dual-site option that provides a secondary guard route in case the primary one fails. How long will the assurance process take? Each business case and proposed solution will be assessed by the UKCloud team, and must be approved by the UKCloud SIRO. We aim to carry out the assessment within five days of receiving the business case and proposed solution, but we can't commit to timelines for approval. Self-managed Walled Garden What is the self-managed Walled Garden? We provide self-service access to the CDSZ so that customers can create their own Walled gardens using the technology and application services of their choice. We provide an assurance wrap by ensuring that customers use appropriate risk management techniques to understand and mitigate identified risks. Is there a setup fee for a Walled Garden? No. What is the assurance wrap? Because a Walled Garden Solution is bespoke, we offer an assurance wrap to guide customers towards an effective design that will help to maximise their chances of meeting compliance requirements. The variable nature of Walled Garden Solutions means we may charge for the assurance wrap on an SFIA rate card basis, according to the number of days' support needed. What is the process for approving a Walled Garden? Broadly, the process is as follows: Initial application UKCloud design review (with a cloud architect) Proposed evidence pack submission (by the customer) Full evidence pack submission (by the customer) UKCloud SIRO review and approval or rejection Full details of each stage are available in the UKCloud Knowledge Centre or from your account director. What type of evidence is required to allow use of the Walled Garden? The evidence pack will generally consist of: IT Security Health Check (ITSHC) This must be carried out by an NCSC-approved security organisation Protective Monitoring solution The nature of Walled Garden solutions makes it essential that appropriate audit logging of security events and information is implemented and regularly monitored. Customer SIRO sign-off We need an accreditor's statement confirming their acceptance of the risk assessment, mitigating controls and residual risks, and their understanding of the customer's obligations relating to the use of UKCloud services What are the ongoing requirements? When the Walled Garden is in operation, the customer is responsible for ensuring continuing compliance with security operating procedures (SyOps) and other security obligations. How long will the assurance process take? The bespoke nature of the Walled Garden means we can't provide committed timescales for each phase in the process. However, we aim to provide feedback from a named source within five days of each submission. Who makes the final decision to allow or deny the use of a Walled Garden? The UKCloud SIRO is ultimately responsible for deciding which solutions and configurations are allowed. Support How do I raise a support ticket?- Our secure online Portal provides service management functionality. Alternatively, you can reach support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Walled Gardens are managed from the higher-security side of the platform (Elevated OFFICIAL). The security requirements are much stricter and require a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or CPA-approved (or equivalent standard) encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? UKCloud's maintenance windows are as follows (times are UK local times): Planned maintenance Any pre-planned maintenance of any infrastructure relating to the services. We'll provide you with at least 14 days' advance notice of any planned maintenance. It will take place between 00:00 and 06:00 Monday to Sunday or between 08:00 and 12:00 on a Saturday or Sunday. No planned maintenance will take place on a Saturday unless agreed in advance by both parties. Emergency Maintenance Any emergency maintenance of any infrastructure relating to the services. Whenever possible, we'll provide you with at least six hours' advance notice of emergency maintenance; and carry it out between 00:00 and 06:00 Monday to Sunday or between 08:00 and 12:00 on a Saturday or Sunday, unless there's an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Billing and legal How will I be billed? Both solutions have a minimum commitment period of one month. The billing models are as follows: UKCloud Guard Billing is based on the amount of data transferred between domains. You buy a starter pack which includes an amount of data that can be transferred. You're billed at an incremental rate for data transferred above the starter pack threshold. Walled Garden Billing is based on the solution design. You pay a monthly rental fee, with additional charges based on the number of VMs required to run the solution. How do I pay for the service? Payment can be made by direct bank transfer (BACS/CHAPS). What are the termination fees? There are no termination fees for most services. We may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service if this is required. Security What data is suitable for the UKCloud assured cloud platform? The platform is hosted in the UK and operated by SC-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including CESG PGA) that it is fully aligned with NCSC Cloud Security Principles, making it ideal for all data classified at OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE) and legacy IL0-IL4 solutions. Is there a protective monitoring service? Protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13."

    "title": "UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process Overview The UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) enables you to securely transfer data between our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL security domains using NCSC-approved cross-domain security patterns. Using the CDSZ you can create applications that are accessible to citizens, but ensure data safety. This document provides an overview of the UKCloud process to be used by customers wanting to purchase CDSZ services (UKCloud Guard, Walled Garden and Secure Remote Access). There are two approaches to applying for CDSZ services: A light touch design review/self-assessment route for customers with simple implementations, or those who are experienced at designing secure solutions. This enables customers who are comfortable with the risk associated with their data to choose which controls and evidence they feel is appropriate to self-certify their cross domain solution. An assurance wrap style approach with UKCloud’s experienced professionals for more complex implementations or those customers who would like support and guidance when developing their solutions. This enables customers who require more support to submit their proposed solution with confidence that it effectively mitigates against risk. In this document, the customer is the UKCloud customer, who may or may not be the ultimate end user of the application. The customer will be responsible for completing any compliance process with the end user, including obtaining sign-off from the relevant data owner. The data owner should be a permanent employee at the data owning organisation with evidence of data ownership, for example an IT Security Officer (ITSO), Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) or accreditor. The data owner can choose to sign off for a single CDSZ implementation or setup a Tell Us Once agreement that signs off all future CDSZ implementations for the customer on behalf of the data owning organisation. UKCloud will maintain a list of all Tell Us Once agreements and any subsequent CDSZ applications by the customer on behalf of the data owner should reference this agreement. Process overview The following table provides more detail about each stage: Stage Name Description 1 Initial Contact Customer contacts UKCloud to register interest in CDSZ service. This can be through My Calls or direct contact with a Sales representative, Technical Account Manager (TAM) or Cloud Architect. 2a Self-Assessment Customer creates document pack to illustrate the solution design and provide evidence that all necessary sign-offs and compliance have been obtained. 2b Assurance Wrap Review Customer creates document pack with assistance from the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architect. 3 Design Review Customer presents the technical solution to Cloud Architect for advice and feedback. 4 Application Submission Customer raises a Service Request and submits document pack. 5 Service Implementation UKCloud provisions service and customer implements their solution. 6 On-Going Compliance UKCloud annually prompts customer to review existing document pack and provide updated information for any changes to design or approvals. Required documents When you apply for a CDSZ service, you must provide the following documents to show that you have identified and mitigated for any risks: Details of your proposed implementation that covers the intended design in the CDSZ, the Assured and Elevated VDCs you are connecting to and data flows. Evidence (for example, email or signed document) of acceptance of risk from the data owning organisation. This should also indicate if this acceptance is a Tell Us Once agreement that will also apply to future CDSZ implementations by the customer on behalf of the data owner. Note If a Tell Us Once agreement is already in place between the customer and the data owner, this evidence is not required, but the customer should indicate that such an agreement is in place so that UKCloud can confirm against our list of trusted partners for the data owner. An explicit statement, as part of the Service Request, that the solution has been reviewed by a named UKCloud Cloud Architect or that you do not require a review. The named Cloud Architect must provide review notes as evidence that the review took place. See Stage 3: Design review . If you're connecting to a PSN Protected enabled VDC, proof of PSN compliance (a copy of PSN CoCo or PSN CoP). Stage 1: Initial contact If you want to use the CDSZ, you can initiate the application process in one of two ways: Raise a Service Request through My Calls, specifying the relevant CDSZ product (UKCloud Guard, Walled Garden or Secure Remote Access). One of our Sales representatives, TAMs, or Cloud Architects will arrange a call to discuss your requirements and then close the Service Request. Contact one of our Sales representatives, TAMs, or Cloud Architects directly to arrange a call to discuss your requirements. During your initial conversation, our Cloud Architect will discuss your proposed implementation and help determine the best approach for your situation: If your implementation is simple, or you're confident with designing a solution that mitigates the risk associated with your data and choosing the controls and evidence appropriate to that solution, you can follow our self-assessment option. If your implementation is complex, or you'd prefer some guidance to identify risks and how to mitigate against them, we can provide an assurance wrap style approach with our experienced professionals for more complex implementations. The following table lists some examples of simple versus complex designs: Criteria Simple Complex Business case Common use cases, aligned with Government Digital Strategy. Use cases where no precedent has been established. Multi-tenant solutions. Technical architecture Standard architecture compliant with NCSC design patterns or UKCloud published blueprints. Deviations from established models or blueprints. Non-fully virtualised solutions, for example with elements of hosting within our Cloud Enablement service. Risk ownership Clear accreditation by a single recognised SIRO within a UK public sector organisation. Shared accreditation. Accreditation by private sector authority. Stage 2a: Self-assessment If you choose to self-assess your implementation, you must gather all the documents listed in Required Documents. With self-assessment, you can still request a design review from one of our Cloud Architects. See Stage 3: Design review . Stage 2b: Assurance wrap review If you choose an assurance wrap review for your proposed implementation, the UKCloud compliance team and Cloud Architects will work with you to help identify risks to your solution. This includes: Review of design and data flow with a Cloud Architect (see Stage 3: Design review ) Advice and guidance for how to design secure solutions with appropriate monitoring and logging Conversation between UKCloud SIRO and customer SIRO or nominated representative covering risk management and mitigation, with further workshops if required Review of customer-defined ITHC scope and summary with a Cloud Architect Note UKCloud takes no ownership or responsibility for the implementation or running of your proposed solution or ownership for any risks to the data. Note UKCloud reserves the right to charge SFIA day rate charges for time spent on customer projects if you disengage with the assurance wrap review process before completion. At the end of the review period, you will have generated all the necessary documents to apply for your CDSZ service (as listed in Required documents ). Stage 3: Design review The design review is facilitated by a Cloud Architect and will gather a clearer understanding of how the proposed design aligns with recognised good security practice. Present your technical solution to a Cloud Architect. You can do this via teleconference, Webex or face-to-face as appropriate. The Cloud Architect will be looking to see evidence of effective mitigation for common risks (for example, technical controls like firewall, anti-malware and protective monitoring). The Cloud Architect will provide advice and guidance on aspects of the solution that are likely to raise concerns. You may revise your design to incorporate feedback from the design review. Note If you are self-assessing your proposed implementation, this stage is optional but you must provide a statement in your document pack indicating that you do not require a review. Stage 4: Application submission Raise a Service Request specifying the relevant CDSZ product (UKCloud Guard, Walled Garden or Secure Remote Access) and attach all the required documents , as well as any review notes from the assurance wrap review. This request will then be assigned to a UKCloud representative to verify that all required information has been provided. If any documents are missing or empty, a UKCloud representative will contact you to ensure that all required documents are provided before the service is provisioned. Stage 5: Service implementation When the assigned UKCloud representative has determined that all the appropriate information has been provided, the requested CDSZ service will be provisioned within five working days. When your service has been provisioned, you can implement your proposed solution. Stage 6: On-going compliance On an annual basis, UKCloud requires evidence of on-going compliance. You will be contacted by your Technical Account Manager (TAM) to review the existing documents and inform us if any of the details or approvals have changed. If you're connecting to a PSN Protected enabled VDC, proof of PSN compliance (a copy of PSN CoCo or PSN CoP) must be provided on a yearly basis. Once the relevant PSN certificate (if required) is provided, and provided there are no changes the original design, your CDSZ service will continue without interruption. If, after examination of the existing documents, you identify that there have been changes, for example if the design has changed from the initial solution or there is a different data owner approver, it is your responsibility to submit a revised evidence pack within 15 days. A UKCloud representative will contact you to discuss your changes.

    "keywords": "How to use the Azure Stack API Overview The Azure Stack API enables you to interact programmatically with your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure environment. For example, you can use API calls to manage your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure tenancy. This guide shows you how to get started with the Azure Stack API. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have the appropriate permissions on the resource you are trying to access. Authenticating to the API Azure Stack API authentication uses access tokens to validate requests. To obtain an access token: Send a POST request to the Azure REST authentication/login endpoint: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/token where tenant_id is one of: Your tenant domain, for example, ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com , ukcloud.com , example.mydomain.com Your tenant ID, for example 8eaef023-2b34-4da1-9baa-8bc8c9d6a490 The default value for tenant independent keys: common Pass the following parameters in the request body: grant_type - The type of authentication scheme to use: password client_id - Hard-coded to a default value of 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 Other options for specific scenarios are: LegacyPowerShell - 0a7bdc5c-7b57-40be-9939-d4c5fc7cd417* PowerShell - 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 WindowsAzureActiveDirectory - 00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 VisualStudio - 872cd9fa-d31f-45e0-9eab-6e460a02d1f1 AzureCLI - 04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46 resource - The endpoint of the resource the token will be used to access, for example, https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/4de154de-a8a8-4017-af41-df619da68154 You can obtain the resource endpoint by querying the Azure Stack management metadata endpoint. The resource endpoint is returned in the audiences section of the response. For example, to find the endpoint for the operators resource send a request to https://adminmanagement.<region>.<AzureStackdomain>/metadata/endpoints?api-version=2015-01-01 username - The Azure Stack AAD account, for example azurestackadmin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com password - The password for the Azure Stack AAD account scope - optional, such as openid to get the ID token For example: grant_type=password &client_id=1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 &resource=(endpoint returned in the audiences section below) &username=admin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com &password=Password123 &scope=openid Note Format the request body using the Content-Type x-www-form-urlencoded . An example request might look something like the following curl -X \"POST\" \"https://login.windows.net/160f539f-8571-4c96-9361-797645c24e75/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ --data-urlencode \"client_id=1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2\" \\ --data-urlencode \"grant_type=password\" \\ --data-urlencode \"username=admin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com\" \\ --data-urlencode 'password=Password12345' \\ --data-urlencode \"resource=https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/c0a3a144-57ae-42e2-a5da-19e945a25deb\" If the authentication is successful, the endpoint returns an access token. For example: { \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"scope\": \"user_impersonation\", \"expires_in\": \"3599\", \"ext_expires_in\": \"0\", \"expires_on\": \"1512574780\", \"not_before\": \"1512570880\", \"resource\": \"https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/c0a3a144-57ae-42e2-a5da-19e945a25deb\", \"access_token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" } You must include this token in the Authorization header of each subsequent API request. For example: curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" 'https://management.local.azurestack.external/subscriptions?api-version=2016-05-01' Calling Azure Stack API endpoints A REST request URI consists of: <URI-scheme>://<URI-host>/<resource-path>?<query-string> where: URI-scheme is the protocol used to transmit the request, for example http or https . URI-host is the domain name or IP address of the server where the REST service endpoint is hosted, for example management.local.azurestack.external . resource-path is the resource or resource collection, which may include multiple segments, used by the service in determining the selection of those resources. For example beta/applications/00003f25-7e1f-4278-9488-efc7bac53c4a/owners is the resource path to a specific application's owners within the applications collection. query-string provides additional simple parameters, such as the API version or resource selection criteria. The syntax of an Azure Stack request URI is: https://management.local.azurestack.external/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group>/providers/<provider>/<resource-path>?<filter-expression>&api-version=<api-version> where: subscription-id is your tenant subscription ID resource-group is the resource group you want to query provider is the provider you want to query resource-path is the resource you want to query filter-expression is an optional list of arguments to filter the results of the query api-version is the version of the Azure Stack API being called, for example api-version=2016-05-01 For example, the following API call returns information about region health: https://management.local.azurestack.external/subscriptions/800c4168-3eb1-405b-a4ca-919fe7ee42e9/resourcegroups/system.local/providers/microsoft.infrastructureinsights.admin/regionhealths/local/Alerts?$filter=(Properties/State eq 'Active') and (Properties/Severity eq 'Critical')&$orderby=Properties/CreatedTimestamp desc&api-version=2016-05-01\" Next steps For general information about the Azure API, see the Azure REST API Reference at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/rest/api/?view=Azure In particular, you may find the following documents useful: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-code https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/azure-stack/azure-stack-provider-resource-api.md There is not currently an API reference guide for Azure Stack.

Note You only need your Service Principal Name (SPN) to be assigned to Azure Stack subscription despite what official Terraform documentation says. The process of authentication can be handled in one of two ways, either as Environment Variables or in the Provider Block . Environment Variables Option - you can create your terraform plan by putting only the plan itself into example.tf and then keep variables.tf separately. You have to declare the actual values in terraform.tfvars file. It is this file that you will need to populate with your actual credential details.

    "keywords": "How to create an Azure user group Overview UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides you with three default user groups to get you started: AzureStackOperators - Members of this group have Owner permissions and have full access to all resources and can manage access to resources AzureStackUsers - Members of this group have Contributor permissions and can create and manage all resources but cannot manage access to resources AzureStackReadOnly - Members of this group have Reader permissions and can view everything but cannot make changes If these default groups do not meet your requirements, for example, if you've created a custom role and want to grant users the permissions specified by that role, you can create new groups and assign roles and permissions to them. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have global administrator access to the Azure portal and Owner access to the Azure Stack portal. Creating a group for Azure users Rather than granting permissions to individual users, we recommend that you first create a group and add your Azure users to that group. To create a group in the Azure portal: Log in to the Azure portal as a global administrator: https://portal.azure.com Navigate to the Azure Active Directory . Tip You can find the Azure Active Directory by selecting All services and scrolling down to the Security + Identity section. Select Groups and then All groups . Click the New group option. From the Group type list, select Security . In the Group name field, enter a name for the group, for example, AzureStackGroup . In the Group description field, enter a brief, but meaningful description for the group. From the Membership type list, select Assigned . Click Create . To add users to the group, open the group, select Members then click Add members . Granting Azure permissions After setting up the user group in Azure, you need to go to the Azure Stack portal to grant the appropriate permissions to the group. To grant Azure permissions to a group: Log in to the Azure Stack portal: https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/ Navigate to Subscriptions . Tip If you can't see Subscriptions in your favourites panel, click More services and then Subscriptions . You can add Subscriptions to your favourites panel by clicking the star icon. Select your subscription for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Select Access control (IAM) . Click the Add option. From the Role list, select the appropriate role that you want to assign to the group. In the Select field, enter the name of the group you created in Creating a group for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure users . Click Save .

    "title": "Connect to Azure Stack with CLI environment for UKCloud | based on Microsoft Docs | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Install and configure CLI for use with Azure Stack In this article, we will guide you through the process of installing and using the Azure command-line interface (CLI) to manage Azure Stack. Azure CLI can be used to manage resources such as create virtual machines, deploy Azure Resource Manager templates, etc. Install CLI Sign in to your development workstation and install CLI. Azure Stack requires the 2.0 version of Azure CLI. You can install that by using the steps described in the Install Azure CLI 2.0 article. To verify if the installation was successful, open a terminal or a command prompt window and run the following command: az --version You should see the version of Azure CLI and other dependent libraries that are installed on your computer. Connect to Azure Stack Use the following steps to connect to Azure Stack: Register your Azure Stack environment by running the az cloud register command. To register the user environment, use: az cloud register \\ -n AzureStackUser \\ --endpoint-resource-manager \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" \\ --suffix-storage-endpoint \"frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" \\ --suffix-keyvault-dns \".vault.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" \\ --endpoint-active-directory-graph-resource-id \"https://graph.windows.net/\" \\ To register the user environment - One Liner: az cloud register -n AzureStackUser --endpoint-resource-manager \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --suffix-storage-endpoint \"frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --suffix-keyvault-dns \".vault.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --endpoint-active-directory-graph-resource-id \"https://graph.windows.net/\" --endpoint-vm-image-alias-doc <URI of the document which contains virtual machine image aliases> Set the active environment by using the following commands. For the user environment, use: az cloud set -n AzureStackUser Update your environment configuration to use the Azure Stack specific API version profile. To update the configuration, run the following command: az cloud update --profile 2017-03-09-profile Sign in to your Azure Stack environment by using the az login command. You can sign in to the Azure Stack environment either as a user or as a service principal . Sign in as a user : You can either specify the username and password directly within the az login command or authenticate by using a browser. You have to do the latter if your account has multi-factor authentication enabled. Example of username : Active directory global administrator or user account i.e. username@ .onmicrosoft.com or username@domain.com az login -u username@<aadtenant>.onmicrosoft.com -p <password> Note If your user account has multi-factor authentication enabled, you can use the az login command without providing the -u parameter. Running the command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate. Sign in as a service principal : Before you sign in, create a service principal through the Azure portal or CLI and assign it a role. Now, sign in by using the following command: az login \\ --tenant <Azure Active Directory Tenant name. For example: myazurestack.onmicrosoft.com> \\ --service-principal \\ -u <Application Id of the Service Principal> \\ -p <Key generated for the Service Principal> Verify that your environment is set correctly to and that AzureStackUser is the active cloud. az cloud list --output table To list command subgroups run: az --help To list commands for specific subgroup run: az <subgroupname> --help Test the connectivity Now that we've got everything setup, let's use CLI to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an application and add a virtual machine. Use the following command to create a resource group named \"MyResourceGroup\": az group create -n MyResourceGroup -l frn00006 If the resource group is created successfully, the previous command outputs the following properties of the newly created resource: Get the virtual machine URNs Because of the known issue with Image Aliases we have not published the alias.json file yet. Instead please use the following command to obtain releveant image URNs for your VM deployment. az vm image list --all --output table You are retrieving all the images from server which could take more than a minute.

Note Azure Stack does not support Managed Disks hence we add --use-unmanaged-disk parameter. Also, you need to create your Resource Group first. admin-username and admin-password are given as examples above - these are the credentials which must be used to login to the VM once it is created. Known issues There are some known issues that you must be aware of when using CLI in Azure Stack: The CLI interactive mode i.e the az interactive command is not yet supported in Azure Stack. To get the list of virtual machine images available in Azure Stack, use the az vm images list --all command instead of the az vm image list command. Specifying the --all option makes sure that response returns only the images that are available in your Azure Stack environment. Virtual machine image aliases that are available in Azure may not be applicable to Azure Stack. When using virtual machine images, you must use the entire URN parameter (Canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.3-LTS:1.0.0) instead of the image alias. This URN must match the image specifications as derived from the az vm images list command. By default, CLI 2.0 uses “Standard_DS1_v2” as the default virtual machine image size. However, this size is not yet available in Azure Stack, so, you need to specify the --size parameter explicitly when creating a virtual machine. You can get the list of virtual machine sizes that are available in Azure Stack by using the az vm list-sizes --location frn00006 command.

    "href": "articles/vmware/vmw-how-zerto-perform-failover.html",
    "title": "How to perform a failover | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Overview You may want to perform a failover in the following circumstances: To recover virtual machines (VMs) after a disaster, if you're using Disaster Recovery as a Service or the UKCloud for VMware Journaling Protection option To migrate workloads from a local, on-premises environment onto the UKCloud platform With Disaster Recovery as a Service and Journaling Protection, you can also run a test failover to verify that, during recovery, your protected VMs are correctly replicated at the target site. Important During the failover process, any change in the configuration or state of the live or failed‑over VMs (for example, power on or power off) will cause failure of the failover and may corrupt the VPG. This could make a full resync necessary and, in a disaster recovery situation, could prevent failover completely. Intended audience To perform the steps in this guide you need access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the target zone. Running a test failover If you use Disaster Recovery as a Service or Journaling Protection, you should periodically run test failovers to verify that, in the case of a live failover, your VMs can be recovered successfully. When you run a test failover, a test VM is created for each of your protected VMs in a sandbox on the target site, using the test network specified in the virtual protection group (VPG). During the test, your VMs' journals continue to be updated and new checkpoints generated, ensuring that your VMs remain protected and can be fully recovered in the event of an actual live failover. Note When the test failover has been instantiated, Zerto will automatically start up the test failover VMs. It is critically important that you do not power on (or power off) the VMs manually in vCloud Director before the failover is completely instantiated. Changing the state of the VMs in vCloud Director before the failover process is complete will result in corruption of the VPG. If you power off a failed-over VMs while a test failover is in progress, replication of live VMs will be affected. Log in to the ZSSP. For more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. At the bottom of the page, make sure that the failover toggle is set to TEST and click FAILOVER . In the Failover Test wizard, in the SELECT VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to test then click NEXT . The EXECUTION PARAMETERS page shows the most recent checkpoint added to the journal. If you want to use a different checkpoint for the test, click the Checkpoint time. In the Checkpoints dialog, select the checkpoint that you want to use: Latest to use the latest checkpoint Latest Tagged Checkpoint to use the latest manually added checkpoint Latest VSS to use the latest VSS snapshot (this option is applicable only for Disaster Recovery as a Service and if you've installed the Zerto VSS agent on the VM) Select from all available checkpoints to select a specific checkpoint from the list below Click OK then click NEXT . In the FAILOVER TEST page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the test and where they will be recovered to, then click START FAILOVER TEST . The test begins with an initialisation period, during which the VMs are created in scratch volumes on the target site. You can check the status of the test by clicking the VPG Name on the VPGs tab. To stop the test, on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and click the Stop test icon. In the Stop Test dialog, from the Result list, choose whether the test succeeded or failed, then click STOP . You can also provide additional Notes to describe the test scenario. After you stop the test, the test VMs are powered off and removed. Running a live failover In the event of a disaster, you'll need to run a live failover to recover your VMs. You can also use live failover to migrate your workloads to the target site. Note When the failover has been instantiated, Zerto will automatically start up the failover VMs. It is critically important that you do not power on (or power off) the VMs manually in vCloud Director before the failover is completely instantiated. Changing the state of the VMs in vCloud Director before the failover process is complete will result in corruption of the VPG and potentially the failure of the disaster recovery process. Log in to the ZSSP. For more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC (for recovery or migration) is located. At the bottom of the page, make sure that the failover toggle is set to LIVE and click FAILOVER . In the Failover wizard, in the SELECT VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to failover or migrate then click NEXT . Tip The red border around the wizard provides a visual cue that you are performing a live failover, rather than a test. The EXECUTION PARAMETERS page shows the most recent checkpoint added to the journal. If you want to use a different checkpoint, click the Checkpoint time. In the Checkpoints dialog, select the checkpoint that you want to use: Latest to use the latest checkpoint Latest Tagged Checkpoint to use the latest manually added checkpoint Latest VSS to use the latest VSS snapshot (this option is applicable only for Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud, and if you've installed the Zerto VSS agent on the VM) Select from all available checkpoints to select a specific checkpoint from the list below Click OK . The commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the recovered or migrated VMs before committing the failover. To change the commit policy, select the Commit Policy field and choose: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the failover after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the failover to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the failover after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the failover to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the failover. The shutdown policy determines what happens to the source VMs in the event of a failover. To change the shutdown policy, select the VM Shutdown field and choose: No to leave the source VMs as they are before starting the failover. Yes if the source VMs have VMware Tools available so that they can be gracefully shut down before starting the failover or migration. If the VMs cannot be shut down, the failover fails. Force Shutdown to forcibly shut down the source VMs before starting the failover. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are failed over to the target site, the source site becomes the new target site to ensure that the VMs are still protected. To enable reverse protection, select the Reverse Protection field and select the check box. Important Reverse protection uses the original source VM's virtual disks to pre‑seed the reverse replication, therefore enabling reverse protection will make changes to the source VMs. Click NEXT . In the FAILOVER page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the failover and where they will be recovered or migrated to, then click START FAILOVER . The failover process creates the VMs in the target site to the selected point in time. Note If a VM already exists on the target site with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the recovered or migrated VM name to ensure that it's unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the recovered or migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the failover. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto‑commit or auto‑rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. Note As soon as a live failover is committed, the journal is destroyed and you cannot go back and select a different checkpoint. However, provided reverse protection is not enabled, the original VMs on the source site remain in place. When the commit is completed, the VPG will show as being in Needs Configuration state. When in this state, editing the VPG configuration may cause reverse protection to begin. If this is not desired, then you should delete VPG as soon as it reaches the Needs Configuration state. Next steps Your VMs are now running in the target site, which is now your primary site.

    "keywords": "How to migrate your workloads between UKCloud regions Overview Journaling Protection is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can help you improve your organisational resilience. However, you can also use UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution to migrate your UKCloud for VMware applications into another UKCloud for VMware-enabled zone. This enables you to move your workloads into the regions within the UKCloud platform that are best suited for their requirements. Our Migration service is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. The migration of VMs within the UKCloud platform is very closely aligned to the disaster recovery of VMs within UKCloud; the small difference being that when you have failed-over the VMs from one region into another, you don't then failback to your primary region. As such, you'll find that the articles linked to from this article refer to disaster recovery and failover, however the steps also apply to migration. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you need to have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Before you begin When you request Journaling Protection to migrate a workload within the UKCloud platform, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP), where you can create and manage your VPGs You should consider the following: Migration is provided on a vApp basis (not for individual VMs). This is worth considering if you intend to migrate only some parts of your vApps. VMs must be powered on to be synchronised prior to migration. Our Journaling Protection service option captures every action. When a VM is deleted from your vApp, the associated journal is also deleted. This means if you delete a VM before migrating it, that VM will not exist in your target region. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the Journaling Protection Service Scope . We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles Migrating workloads between UKCloud regions You begin the migration process for your VMs by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. This creates something called a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the target migration region and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the source region and a copy is asynchronously sent to the target region and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for a specified number of days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the migration target VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. When you're ready to migrate a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. This isn't strictly necessary for workload migration, but is a feature associated with the Journaling Protection aspect of Zerto. It means that you'll have a known point at which the VM will be restarted from in the new region. During migration, the vApp and its VMs are created on the target region and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the migrated VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. The process for getting Journaling Protection up and running ready for workload migration within the UKCloud platform is as follows: Create a migration VDC Configure networking in the migration target VDC Create a virtual protection group in the primary region Perform a test migration Migrate your workloads Create a migration VDC To migrate your workloads to a different UKCloud region, you must have a VDC in the intended target region. If you already have a compute service in the target region, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal - For more information see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware The UKCloud Portal API -- For more information see How to use the UKCloud Portal API If you don't already have a compute service in the target region or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Journaling Protection service request. Configure networking in the migration target VDC You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your migration target environment to duplicate those in the source region. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG; see How to create a virtual protection group . When you initially migrate your workloads, external access to the target region will be via a different IP address. If you want to keep the same IP addresses for your new environment, you'll need to request an IP move from UKCloud. We'll move the IPs from your old edge to your new edge. Note that you should raise this service request in good time so we can move the IPs as soon as you need us to. Alternatively, you can use the new allocation of IP addresses in your new environment. You don't need to configure vApp networks in advance as they'll be replicated within the VPG. Create a virtual protection group in the primary region A VPG is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for migration. As workload migration within the UKCloud platform uses Journaling Protection, VPGs are created from vApps. When you create a VPG, you specify the vApp you want to migrate and all the VMs in that vApp are replicated. For example, in a standard three-tier application, you'll likely have three VMs: one for your application, one for the database and one for the web server. As best practice, you should create these three related VMs in a single vApp, which you can then add to a VPG so that all the VMs are migrated together. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . This guide is the same for both failovers and migrations. Perform a test migration After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test migration to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly when you do the real migration. For more information, see How to perform a failover . This guide is the same for both failovers and migrations. Migrate your workloads If you are happy with your test migration, you can now choose when to migrate your environment from your primary region into your new region. You don't have to migrate everything in one go; you can choose which VPGs you migrate and you can perform a staged migration. Within Zerto, you have two options for migrating your workloads: Move the VPG to the target region. This method performs and end-to-end migration, including removing the VMs from the source region after they've been moved. For more information, see the steps below. Perform a live migration. This method provides more flexibility for you to control what happens in the primary region after you move the VMs to the target region. For more information, see How to perform a failover . To move a VPG: Log in to ZSSP. If you need more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which your target VDC is located. From the ACTIONS menu at the bottom of the page, choose MOVE VPG . In the Move wizard, on the Select VPGs page, select one or more VPGs that you want to move then click NEXT . On the EXECUTION PARAMETERS page, the commit policy gives you the opportunity to check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing the move. To change the commit policy, select the Commit Policy field and choose: Auto-Commit if you want to automatically commit the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately committed, enter 0. Auto-Rollback if you want to automatically roll back the move after a specified amount of time if there is no user interaction. Set the amount of time in the After field, up to a maximum of 1440 minutes (24 hours). If you want the move to be immediately rolled back, enter 0. None if you do not want to apply a commit policy. You must manually commit or roll back the move. The source VMs must be powered off before they can be migrated. If the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, you can force a shutdown. To force shutdown, select the Force Shutdown check box. If you do not select this option and the VMs cannot be gracefully shut down, the move process fails. Reverse protection ensures that when the source VMs are migrated to the target region, the source region becomes the new target region. Reverse protection is enabled by default, but you should disable it by clicking the Reverse Protection field and deselecting the REVERSE check box. Click NEXT . On the MOVE page, review the diagram to see the number of VPGs and VMs included in the move and where they will be moved to, then click START MOVE . The move process creates the VMs in the target region. Note If a VM already exists on the target region with the same name as one of the source VMs, a number is added to the end of the target VM name to ensure that it is unique. If you set a commit policy with a time greater than zero, you can check the integrity of the migrated VMs before committing (or rolling back) the migration. When you've finished testing, you can either wait for the time to elapse before the auto commit or auto rollback, or on the VPGs tab, click the VPG Name and then click the Commit or Rollback icon as required. After the migrated VMs are up and running and committed in the target region, the powered off VMs in the source region are removed from the source region and data from the journal is promoted to the migrated VMs. You should have disabled reverse protection to stop your migrated VMs from being protected on the source region. Next steps After you've completed the migration, you can continue working with your applications as before. If you used failover to migrate your workloads, when you've determined that the migration has been successful, you should remove the original VMs from the source region to remove any workloads that are no longer required. You can use Journaling Protection to protect your newly migrated VMs by replicating to another region within UKCloud. Note While you can set up Journaling Protection for migration purposes in regions 1 and 2, the target environment for Journaling Protection for failover is available only in regions 5 and 6.

UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service enables you to provide a secure, scalable disaster recovery solution for your on-premises environment by replicating your workloads on the UKCloud platform Migration to the Cloud enables you to move your workloads from a local, on-premises environment onto the UKCloud platform. Our Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud services are powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud, so you'll need to install Zerto software in your local environment to enable the replication of your workloads to the UKCloud platform. You'll also need to create a IPsec VPN to connect your local environment to the UKCloud. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you must have administrator access to the vCenter Server that hosts the VMs that you want to protect or migrate. Before you begin When you raise a Service Request for Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto A link to the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment as well as a site address and port for licensing purposes The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your target VDC (for recovery or migration); you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your target VDC Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the UKCloud zone where your target VDC is located Installing and configuring Zerto Virtual Manager in your local environment As UKCloud's Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud services are powered by Zerto, you need to set up Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment to enable your VMs to be replicated on the UKCloud platform. ZVM is responsible for all the Zerto configuration for a site and performs the replication tasks. UKCloud provides a version of ZVM that is compatible with the Zerto software on the UKCloud platform. Download and run the executable file from the link provided by UKCloud. Note Install ZVM on a Windows 2008r2 or 2012r2 server, ideally with nothing else running on it.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for OpenStack Overview If you're new to UKCloud, you'll probably have received this guide as part of your welcome email. This Getting Started Guide covers basic topics like where to find your instances (virtual machines, or VMs, in VMware terminology), as well as more in-depth topics such as instance storage choice (ephemeral or volume storage) and its implications. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to learn more about UKCloud for OpenStack. Logging in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard The first thing you need to do is to log in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. Go to the URL provided in your welcome email. The examples in this guide use https://cor00005.cni.ukcloud.com/ . Enter your login credentials and click Connect . After logging in, the first screen you'll see is the Overview page. From here you can get an immediate summary of your project and show your resource usage against the quotas on the project. Creating your network infrastructure Before you can begin creating instances, you must first build out the underlying network infrastructure. In a freshly provisioned project, the only resource that will exist initially is a shared external network called internet . You need to create the following minimum set of resources: A router using the internet external network A network and associated subnet, specifying the network address using CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/24), and DHCP settings for DNS, static routes, and so on. A router interface to connect the router to your new subnet When you have created these elements, you can view them in the Network Topology page in the Horizon dashboard. You can create your network infrastructure in one of the following ways: Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure (see Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure ) Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks (see Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks ) Using the OpenStack API and automation (see [Using the OpenStack API and automation](#using the-openstack-api-and-automation)) Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure The Network Topology page is a useful page to get started with. This page provides a resizable, moveable and interactive view of your OpenStack project, along with easily accessible buttons for manually creating routers and networks and for launching instances. To create your network infrastructure: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Network menu on the left side of the screen and select Network Topology . On the Network Topology page, click the Create Router button. In the Create Router dialog box, enter a Router Name . From the Admin State list, ensure that UP is selected so that the router is online at the point of creation. From the External Network list, select the external network to which you want to attach your router. Click Create Router . Back on the Network Topology page, click the Create Network button. On the Network page of the Create Network wizard, enter a Network Name and click Next . On the Subnet page, enter a Subnet Name . In the Network Address field, allocate your network a suitable address space. In the Gateway IP field, enter an IP address from the address space for the router you created earlier to use to access the network. Click Next . On the Subnet Details page, the only field you'll probably want to change is DNS Name Servers . UKCloud does not provide DNS as a service, so to start with you could make use of Google's public 8.8.8.8 service. You can update this field later if you intend to run your own DNS caching service. If you leave the Allocation Pools field blank, then by default the whole address space is used for the pool. Click Create . To add the router interface to link your new network to the router, on the Network Topology page, select the router and click the Add Interface button. In the Add Interface dialog box, from the Subnet list, select your subnet and then click Add Interface . Understanding access and security Security groups In OpenStack, rather than deploying a perimeter firewall to protect your network from the outside world, every instance is protected by its own firewall. This instance firewall is applied at the network level, independent of any additional firewall the guest operating system may be using. The instance firewall is controlled by applying one or more security groups to the instance, either at instance creation or real-time at any point during the lifecycle of the instance. Where multiple security groups are specified, the firewall rules are the result of compounding all the rules together. A security group consists of one or more rules. Each rule is composed of five elements: Role --- Custom or predefined protocol type (for example, TCP, UDP or ICMP) Direction --- Ingress or Egress Open Port or Port Range --- Open either a single port or a range of ports Remote --- The source of the traffic to be allowed via this rule (source address for an inbound rule, or destination address for an outbound rule) The ether type (that is IPv4 or IPv6) --- Not currently available When adding a new rule to a security group, you can choose from a pre-populated list of common rules, for example, SSH, DNS, HTTP or SMTP, or you can specify your own custom rule. SSH key pairs Another change if you're used to using vCloud Director, is the authenticated access to your instances. OpenStack, like most other cloud providers, doesn't use templates that allow password controlled access. The standard cloud method of authenticating access to a new instance is to use SSH key pair authentication --- your SSH client uses the private key and OpenStack injects the public key into your new instance using the cloud-init package pre-installed in the instance image. Before you launch any instances on OpenStack, you need to set up at least one SSH key pair. You can use OpenStack to create a new key pair for you, or if you have an existing SSH key pair, you can import the public key so that OpenStack can use it to inject into new instances. To see what public keys have already been set up for your use: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . Select the Key Pairs tab. If you want OpenStack to create a key pair for you: Click the Create Key Pair button. In the Create Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and then click Create Key Pair . OpenStack creates the key pair and downloads it in your web browser. Save the file somewhere safe as you will need it when connecting your SSH client to your instances. To import an existing public key: On the Key Pairs tab of the Access & Security page, click the Import Key Pair button. In the Import Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and paste the contents of your existing public key file into the Public Key field. Click Import Key Pair . Note for Windows users If you're using a Windows desktop environment, the chances are that you're using the PuTTY program for your SSH client. The PuTTY SSH client doesn't use OpenSSH format files for the key pair files. It does however provide a PuTTYgen program that can import and export in the correct format as outlined below. If you want OpenStack to create your key pair: Open PuTTYgen. From the Conversions menu select Import key . Select the downloaded private key file generated by OpenStack. Click the Save private key button to save the imported key as a ppk file that PuTTY can use for authentication. If you want to import an existing key: Open PuTTYgen. Click the Generate button. Copy the public key from the top of the dialog box. Paste the public key into the Public Key field in Horizon's Import Key Pair dialog box. Launching your instances Now that you've considered security, created a network and a subnet, and you've connected them to your external network with a router, you can start to think about launching some instances attached to the network. There are a few choices you need to make when launching your instances. The following sections outline how to achieve this task via the Horizon dashboard, however you can also use HEAT templates or the OpenStack API. Choosing your image When you create an instance in OpenStack, its disk is cloned from an image managed by OpenStack. The image may be a custom image that has been developed for a specific purpose and uploaded to your project. It may also be a custom image that has been specifically shared between two projects. More likely, you'll start by using one of the public images that we provide and manage on our platform. You can see the images that are available for you to use by expanding the Compute menu on the left side of the Horizon dashboard and clicking Images . Choosing your instance size If you're already familiar with UKCloud's vCloud Director-based Enterprise Compute Cloud service, then you may be used to being able to choose exactly how many vCPUs and how much memory a VM is allocated. In OpenStack, you choices are restricted to a number of pre-defined flavors that define how many vCPUs, how much memory and how much storage an instance may use. Although full details for each flavor are available through the Horizon UI, there's no overall list available showing all the different flavors and sizes of instances. However, if you've installed the OpenStack CLI tools (see http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html ), you can run the following command to retrieve a list of the flavors and their makeup \\> openstack flavor list Choosing your storage type There are two storage options available for use with your instances: Ephemeral storage (default) Persistent volume storage Ephemeral storage When you create an instance, the default behaviour is to clone your chosen disk image onto the physical disk attached to the host that will be running the instance. This is not dedicated locally attached storage to your instance, but rather a RAID array of fast SSD disks that is shared by all the instances running on the host hypervisor. The performance of the ephemeral storage makes for very fast disk access. However, as the disk image is stored locally on the host hypervisor, you're at risk of data loss in the event of hardware failure on the host. For scheduled maintenance on the host, you can live‑migrate instances onto other hosts with minimal interruption. If the host were to suffer a hardware failure, it's likely that you'd lose the data stored on the disk image, so you should architect your application to expect and be able to recover from failure. Persistent volume storage As an alternative to ephemeral storage you can clone your chosen disk image to an OpenStack volume , which is a persistent storage option backed by a Ceph storage array. The volume is then network mounted onto the host hypervisor and the instance booted from the network attached storage. For scheduled maintenance on the host, these instances are more easily managed onto other hosts. In the event of a hardware failure on the host, the volume can just be mounted to another host and the instance restarted without any data loss. For more information about volumes, see Working with volumes . Creating an instance You can create a new instance in the Horizon UI. Click or select Launch Instance on one of the following pages: Images page (under the Compute menu) Instances page (under the Compute menu) Network Topology page (under the Networks menu) On the Details tab of the Launch Instance dialog box, enter an Instance Name and select a Flavor . As you select a flavor from the list, the dialog box updates to reflect the VCPUs , Disk and RAM that the selected flavour gives you and the green bars under Project Limits update to show what your usage would be after launching the instance. If you select a flavour that would take you over your project's quota, the bar is red rather than green. From the Instance Boot Source list, select: Boot from image to create an instance that boots from the local ephemeral storage. Boot from image (creates a new volume) to create an instance that boots from a volume From the Image Name list, select your preferred image. If you're creating an image that boots from a volume, you can choose what size to create the boot disk without being restricted to the disk allocation specified by the selected flavour. On the Access & Security tab, from the Key Pair list, select the SSH key pair you want to inject into your new instance. If there is only one SSH key pair configured in your project, it will be automatically selected. Select one or more Security Groups to apply to the instance. On the Networking tab, from the Available networks list, select the network that you want to create the new instance on. If your project has only a single network defined, that network will already be listed under Selected networks . Click Launch and OpenStack reports that your new instance is launching. Accessing your instance Having successfully launched your new instance, you'll want to log in and start installing your applications. To access your new instance from the outside world, you have to associate a floating IP address to the instance. A floating IP address is a public routable address that is allocated to your project. Having allocated an address to your project, you can then choose to associate it to a particular instance. When you've done this, a DNAT rule is automatically created on the router you created earlier to forward all incoming traffic to your chosen instance. To associate a floating IP address to your new instance: On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Associate Floating IP . In the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, from the IP Address list, select the floating IP address that you want to allocate to the instance. If you don't have any spare floating IP addresses allocated to your project, you can click the + button next to the IP Address list to allocate a new address. In the Allocate Floating IP dialog box, from the Pool list, select the pool from which to allocate the floating IP address. Currently the only option is internet , but the list will expand as additional networks come online. Click Allocate IP to allocate the new floating IP address to your project. Back in the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, associate the new address with your instance. Click Allocate IP . You can use your SSH client to connect to the floating IP address, authenticating the connection with the private key that matches the key pair you selected when you launched the instance. You can find more information about using and controlling instances and images on OpenStack in the Red Hat documentation at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/instances-and-images-guide/instances-and-images-guide . Working with volumes Creating a volume Volumes are block devices that you can attach to instances. Because volumes are replicated across OpenStack's storage array, effectively providing three copies of data from a resilience perspective, they provide the basis of our persistent storage offering. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, click the Create Volume button. In the Create Volume dialog box, enter a Volume Name and Description . From the Volume Source list, select: No source, empty volume to create a totally empty volume for customer to populate with their data (this is the default option) Image to enable customer to create a prepopulated volume from a previously created image From the Volume Type list, select: Tier 1 for our most performant block storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput Tier 2 for block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage (this is the default option) From the Size list, select the size of your volume in GiB. From the Availability Zone list, select the availability zone to which you want to target your volume. Create Create Volume . Retyping a volume You can retype a volume to take an existing volume of a particular volume type and converting it to another (that is, from Tier 1 to Tier 2 or vice versa). Retyping a volume attached to an instance Due to a dependency on the underlying hypervisor, it is not currently possible to retype a volume that is attached to an instance. If you want to retype a volume that is attached to an instance, you must first detach the volume from the instance. To detach the volume from the instance, in the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to detach, from the list on the far right of the page, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, click the Detach Volume button. Retype the volume by following the steps in Retyping an independent volume . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to reattach, from the list on the far right, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, from the Attach to Instance list, select the instance to which you want to reattach the volume and click the Attach Volume button. Note If you attempt to retype a volume that is still attached to an instance, the process will attempt to run but will fail without notification. Retyping an independent volume If the volume that you want to retype is not attached to an instance, you can retype it. Ensure that the volume is detached from any instances. For information about how to detach an volume from an instance, see Retyping a volume attached to an instance . In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to retype, from the list on the far right of the page, select Change Volume Type . In the Change Volume Type dialog box, from the Type drop down list, select the new type for the volume. From the Migration Policy list, ensure that you select On Demand . Note If any other option is selected, the retyping process will not work. Click Change Volume Type . Note You may notice duplicate volumes while the retyping process is running. These duplicate volumes will disappear when the process has completed. Important Do not attach a retyped volume to an instance until the retyping process has completed successfully. Retyping an independent volume using the OpenStack CLI To retype a volume using the OpenStack CLI, use the following command: \\> cinder retype *volume* *volume-type* Where: volume is the name or ID of the volume that you want to retype volume-type is the new volume type Working with the API and automation Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks OpenStack provides an orchestration tool out of the box. The Heat tool enables you to describe your infrastructure as a text file, referred to as a Heat template , defining one or more resources using a YAML format. Having defined your resources in your Heat template, you then use the template to create a stack . The stack contains the instantiation of the resources defined in the YAML file, along with a history of events and operations that have happened to the resources in the stack. For an example of what a basic Heat template looks like, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/blob/master/heat/example.yaml The example.yaml template creates the same router, network, subnet and router interface that you created manually above. In addition, the template defines an SSH key pair, security groups and launch instances. We'll look at these other resource elements in more detail later. To use a template to create a stack in your project: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Orchestration menu on the left side of the screen and select Stacks . On the Stacks page, click the Launch Stack button. On the Select Template page, from the Template Source list, select URL . In the Template URL field, enter the URL of the Raw version of the template that you want to use (for example, the example.yaml template). Click Next . On the Launch Stack page, enter a Stack Name and select the flavour and image as required. Click Launch to start creating the stack resources in the background. You can go back to the Stacks page to view progress, drill down into the resources defined in the stack and see the events as they happen. You can also use an updated Heat template to apply an update to resources in a stack. You can also destroy an entire stack, cleaning up all the resources that you previously created. This makes Heat a very powerful tool for creating short‑lived test and preproduction environments on‑demand that may form part of a continuous delivery pipeline. Using the OpenStack API and automation OpenStack also provides a fully functional API to enable programmatic control over your project. The Horizon UI you used earlier is itself a client that makes calls to this underlying API. Although you can write your own code to interact with the API, there are a number of different libraries already available covering most popular programming languages. Alternatively, there is also a growing number of DevOps automation tools available (for example, Terraform and Ansible) that interact with the OpenStack API to orchestrate the creation and ongoing management of your infrastructure. For an example Terraform configuration to create a similar network infrastructure to the one you created in the previous examples, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/tree/master/terraform-os . Whatever library or automation tools you choose to use, you'll need to know a few important details to make a connection to and authenticate against the API. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . On the Access and Security page, select the API Access tab. On the API Access tab, you can see all the relevant API endpoints for making connections to the various OpenStack subsystems, including the Identify endpoint, which provides the initial authentication process, that you'll typically need when configuring connections. You can also download your user's OpenStack RC file for use in the following section. Using the OpenStack command-line client The OpenStack project provides a command‑line client that enables you to access the project API through easy‑to‑use commands. For example, the Compute service provides a NOVA command‑line client. You can run the commands from the command line, or include the commands in scripts to automate tasks. If you provide OpenStack credentials, such as your user name and password, you can run these commands on any computer. The following file is a bash shell script format file that sets up all the relevant environment variables in the Linux shell session so that you can use the OpenStack CLI tools. The OpenStack CLI tools, just like the Horizon UI, also communicate with the OpenStack API. This means you can examine the contents of the RC file to find the settings that you may need to pass into, for example, a Terraform provider definition when configuring it to manage your OpenStack project. The key values to note here are the OS\\_AUTH\\_URL , OS\\_TENANT\\_NAME and OS\\_USERNAME environment variables, as these will be common to any API authentication request. In addition, creating the line export OS\\_INTERFACE=public in the RC file should address any issues you may have accessing the Admin API endpoints.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage Introduction UKCloud's Cloud Storage service is an object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Access is via a RESTful application programming interface (API), which also provides support for Amazon's S3 API. This Getting Started Guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Cloud Storage up and running in your environment. It also looks at common use cases for API‑based object storage within web applications and provides information about some command-line tools that you can use to interact with the storage APIs. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to learn more about UKCloud's Cloud Storage service. Cloud Storage overview Cloud Storage: Is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases Is based on object storage technology that is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility Removes the complexity of capacity management by utilising a pay‑as‑you‑go model, so you pay for what you use, when you use it, scaling indefinitely and on demand Natively enables application deduplication and redundancy to ensure the highest level of data availability, while reducing the cost and management of on-premises storage solutions Provides easy access to storage anywhere, any time, to any device, using HTTP(S) to simplify the integration of object storage systems into cloud‑based solutions by removing the need to rely on the availability of web, file or FTP servers Offloads objects (files, media, images) from compute resources, reducing the load on server resources Automatically replicates and distributes objects to give high levels of data durability and availability, eliminating the need for cloud backup and recovery ECS provides two APIs that you can use to manage your cloud storage: the S3‑compatible API and the EMC ECS Atmos API. Note If you write content to cloud storage using one of the APIs, you cannot subsequently access that content using the other API. Choose carefully which API you want to use before beginning a project, as it will be difficult to move between them. The key differences between the two APIs are: The ECS S3-compatible API enables you to easily migrate applications between Atmos, S3 and other S3‑compatible storage; but not all functionality available in S3 is available on ECS as shown in the S3 Supported Features chapter of the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide ). The ECS Atmos API provides backward compatibility with the EMC Atmos platform. It offers access to the majority of the features of the platform with certain exceptions as listed in the Atmos Supported Features chapter of the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide . Cloud Storage use cases The low cost of cloud storage per GB, as well as its almost unlimited scalability, means there's a large variety of use cases for it. For example, it's ideal for data archives, backups, log files, and media repositories. We anticipate that most web applications can make good use of cloud storage for static content, such as images and downloadable binaries. Storing these items in cloud storage—rather than in primary storage attached to web servers, inside the database or on a traditional file share—can provide significant benefits in terms of cost savings, agility and performance. For example, with an internet-facing application that enables users to download forms and guides in PDF, these items are often stored in primary storage attached to the web servers, which creates several challenges: Whenever a PDF is updated, the updated copy must be replicated to all web servers When an item is downloaded, the bandwidth usage of the web server in question increases Multiple simultaneous downloads could overload the web servers or other components of the network infrastructure Each object is stored multiple times in primary storage, increasing the overall cost of storage On the other hand, storing this content in cloud storage overcomes these challenges because: Only one copy of each item is stored, so updates only need to be made in one place End users connect directly to cloud storage to download PDFs, bypassing the web servers and associated network infrastructure Objects are stored only once, and at a much lower price per GB, which substantially reduces the overall cost of storage The same principles apply to other static content, such as images and (especially) videos. The more workload you can offload onto an external system such as cloud storage, the leaner your application infrastructure can become. There are often questions around how best to implement this. Ultimately, it's up to the application developers, but a popular approach is as follows: Handle content uploads and creation on the web servers. Perform any required modifications or transformations using on-demand processing servers (usually from a message queue). Write the content into cloud storage, storing the resulting object IDs, external URLs and any other relevant metadata in the application database. This process provides a relatively simple transition to cloud storage. The application still knows about all the objects, but rather than retrieving, for example, a relative path for an item from the database, its entire URL is retrieved, pointing to cloud storage. Before you begin When you request your Cloud Storage service, UKCloud Support creates a namespace in the specified account. If you have requested an Atmos subtenant, this is also created. To create S3 buckets, use any S3-compliant tool. To create additional namespaces or Atmos subtenants, you must raise a service request. You can have S3 buckets and Atmos subtentants in the same namespace. Cloud Storage provides different API endpoints to access your storage, depending on the UKCloud site and connectivity type you are using. Make sure you use the correct endpoint to ensure the best possible performance for your solution. S3 API endpoint Atmos API endpoint Corsham (Assured) Internet cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com PSN Assured cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com N3 cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Farnborough (Assured) Internet cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com PSN Assured cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com N3 cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ atmos.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ If you're using the ENHANCED option (geo-resilient storage), you can use either the Corsham or Farnborough endpoints. In the event of a site failure, there will be an outage to objects created on the failed site. UKCloud will bring these objects online in the other site within about 15 minutes. Contact UKCloud support if you are unsure which endpoint to use. Using the ECS S3-compatible API The S3-compatible API is at: https://<api_endpoint> Check which api_endpoint to use in Before you begin , for example: https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com To help get you started, you can find developer resources on the Amazon web site at: https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/ For details of the supported and unsupported S3 operations on ECS, see: https://www.emc.com/techpubs/ecs/ecs_s3_supported_features-1.htm You may also find the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide useful: https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu79368.pdf Note Currently the N3 DNS service does not allow UKCloud to create wildcard DNS entries for our services. This means that S3 URLs that feature the bucket as part of the domain do not work (for example, bucket01.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk ). With most S3 tools, you can choose whether to use prefix buckets or suffix buckets. If you are using the service via N3 you'll need to make sure your client tools support suffix buckets. Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl The Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl (S3Curl) is a very useful Perl script, developed by Amazon. It's a wrapper for Curl that calculates the required authentication signature automatically for each request. As the authentication signature changes for every request, this allows Curl to interact with the API outside of code, enabling you to validate that your commands are working correctly and view the raw HTML response from the API, which can be useful when troubleshooting. For more information about S3Curl, see http://aws.amazon.com/code/128 . To use S3Curl: Download S3Curl from the following location: https://github.com/UKCloud/s3curl Install the following required dependency: sudo apt-get install libdigest-hmac-perl yum install perl-Digest-HMAC Create a file named .s3curl in the home directory containing your credentials. For example: %awsSecretAccessKeys = ( UKCloud => { id => '<user_id>', key => '<secret_key>', }, ); Where: user_id is your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) secret_key is your secret key (If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Change the permissions, otherwise the Perl script will refuse to run. chmod 600 .s3curl Make the following small modification to the script itself so that it will work correctly with ECS: Open the s3curl.pl file in your preferred editor (for example, vim or nano). Scroll down until you find the following comment: # begin customizing here The S3 endpoints are defined below this line, so add your Cloud Storage host name to this list as follows: my @endpoints = ('<api_endpoint>', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... For example: #begin customizing here my @endpoints = ('cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... Save the file. S3Curl is now ready to use, so you can call it as follows: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- <curl_arguments> The curl_arguments need to contain the host name and port number. For example, to list your buckets, you could use: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/ Or to delete a file named Lighthouse.jpg in /bucket2 : perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- -X DELETE https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/bucket2/Lighthouse.jpg Using the ECS Atmos API The Atmos API is at: https://<api_endpoint> Check which api_endpoint to use in Before you begin , for example: https://atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com To help get you started, download the appropriate Atmos SDK from the following location: https://community.emc.com/docs/DOC-27910 The SDK provides bindings for all popular languages, as well as some quick start guides. You can find the full API reference in the EMC Atmos Programmer's Guide , which you can download from the following location (or the UKCloud Knowledge Centre): https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu68370.pdf For details of the supported and unsupported Atmos operations on ECS, see: https://www.emc.com/techpubs/ecs/ecs_atmos_supported_features-1.htm You may also find the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide useful: https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu79368.pdf Using a command-line interface Interacting with Cloud Storage via the API directly is ideal for web-based applications, but having access from the command line can help developers with testing and provide scripting access to Cloud Storage. Command‑line interface (CLI) tools enable access from the command line by translating commands into the relevant API calls. There are lots of CLI tools to choose from --- this guide examines two for the S3 API: one each for Linux and Windows. Remember that the APIs are not interchangeable, so if you use the Atmos API in your application, you won't be able to see the data using the S3 CLI. Using S3cmd --- a Linux CLI for the S3 API S3cmd is an open-source tool for Linux, written in Python. To use S3cmd: Download and extract the S3cmd files from the following location: http://s3tools.org/download Create the required configuration files by running the following command: s3cmd ---configure When prompted, provide the following information: Access Key --- your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Secret Key --- your secret key (If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Encryption password --- create a secure password Path to GPG program --- as appropriate for your system Use HTTPS protocol --- Yes You'll be prompted to test the connection. After the test, even if it fails, save the configuration, which will be written to ~/.s3cfg . Edit the ~/.s3cfg file and confirm that the host_base and host_bucket lines look like the following: host_base = <api_endpoint> host_bucket = %(bucket)s.<api_endpoint> Note Ensure that you use the appropriate api_endpoint , as shown in Before you begin , for example: host_base = cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com host_bucket = %(bucket)s.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com Save the file. The S3cmd tool is now ready to use. To list your buckets, run the following command: s3cmd ls You can find detailed instructions for using the tool in the accompanying README file. Using S3Express--- a Windows CLI for the S3 API S3Express is a lightweight command-line tool for Windows that is self-contained in a single executable. It's a licensed product, with free trials also available. To use S3Express: Download and install the S3Express files from the following location: http://www.s3express.com/ Use the following commands to configure the tool to access Cloud Storage: saveauth <user_id> <secret_key> UKCloud setopt --endpoint:<api_endpoint> Where: user_id is your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) secret_key is your secret key (if you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) api_endpoint is the appropriate endpoint, as shown in Before you begin , for example: setopt --endpoint:cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com The S3Express tool is now ready to use. To list your buckets, run the following command: ls For detailed instructions, refer to the Windows help file, which is installed along with the tool. Working with Cloud Storage in the UKCloud Portal Although you will mostly interact with your Cloud Storage service through the API, the UKCloud Portal provides access to some information about your service. Within the UKCloud Portal, you can: View information about the namespaces within your Cloud Storage environment, including: How many buckets are in each namespace Storage consumed by each namespace View a list of users with access to the namespace Reset the secret key for a user View information about the buckets within a namespace, including: API Type: Atmos or S3 Storage consumed by the bucket Number of objects in the bucket View a graphical representation of the storage consumed by a bucket over the last 30 days More information! How to view Cloud Storage information in the UKCloud Portal To access your Cloud Storage service in the UKCloud Portal: Log in to the UKCloud Portal and select your account. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Cloud Storage option and select ECS .

    "keywords": "How to create a virtual protection group Overview A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of virtual machines (VMs) that are grouped together for some purpose, for example data protection, disaster recovery or workload migration. When you create a VPG, a replica virtual disk is created on the target site (for recovery or migration) for each VM in the VPG. These replica disks are then populated with the data in the source VMs by synchronising the VMs with the target site replicas. After the initial synchronisation completes, any writes to disk from the VMs in the source site are sent to the target site. These writes are stored in the target site in journals. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who are: Setting up Disaster Recovery as a Service Setting up Journaling Protection Migrating workloads onto the UKCloud platform For Journaling Protection, you must have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal in the UKCloud zone in which the VMs that you want to protect are located. For Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, you must have access to the Zerto Virtual Manager Web Client in the local environment in which the VMs that you want to protect or migrate are located. Creating a virtual protection group in the Zerto Self-Service Portal (Journaling Protection) If you're creating a VPG for Journaling Protection, you specify the vApp to protect and all the VMs in that vApp are included in the VPG. Log in to the ZSSP. For more detailed instructions, see How to access the Zerto Self-Service Portal . Use the ZSSP login link for the zone in which the VMs that you want to protect are located. Select the VPGs tab and then click NEW VPG . In the Create VPG dialog, specify the VPG Name . The name must be unique and contain no more than 80 characters. From the Available VMs list, select the vApp that contains the VMs that you want to protect. From the Recovery Site list, choose your target site. From the Org vDC list, choose the VDC in which you want to replicate the VMs. UKCloud provides a single Service Profile : System Service Profile . Click SAVE . At this point, the selected VMs are synchronised to the target site. This synchronisation between the source site and target site may take some time, depending on the size of the VMs. After the initial synchronisation, all the VMs in the VPG are fully protected and all write operations to those VMs are sent to the journal. After the initial creation of your VPG, you need to edit it to determine what happens during disaster recovery. On the VPGs tab, click the pencil icon next to your VPG Name . From the Priority list, choose the priority of transferring data from the source site to the target site for this VPG when there is limited bandwidth and more than one VPG is defined on the source site. High - Updates from VPGs with high priority are passed over the WAN first Medium - Updates from VPGs with medium priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the high priority VPGs have used it Low - Updates from VPGs with low priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the medium VPGs have used it Click NEXT . In the VMs page, you can see the VMs that are included in the VPG. Click NEXT . In the REPLICATION page, you can see the options you selected for the Recovery Site and Recovery Org vDC . To change the Storage Profile used for the VMs in the VPG, click VM SETTINGS . You cannot change the Journal Size or Journal Warning Threshold . Click OK when you're done. Click NEXT . The STORAGE page displays the storage used for the VM data (by default, this is the same storage as that used for the VM definition). If you want to edit the storage settings for a VM, select the VM and then click EDIT SELECTED . Note Make sure that the Thin checkbox is selected for all VMs. When you've finished setting the options for each of the VMs, click NEXT . In the RECOVERY page, from the Failover/Move Network list, choose the network to use in the target site for a live failover. From the Failover Test Network list, choose the network to use in the target site for a test failover of VMs. If you select Isolated , the network interface controller (NIC) will not be connected to the VM when it's brought up in the target site. vCD Guest Customization controls whether the failed‑over VM is subject to guest customization to set its IP address inside its operating system. Click NEXT . In the NICs page, specify the network interface controller (NIC) to use for the VMs after a live or test failover. Note If you specify different IP addresses (or use IP Pool ) for the IP addresses here, you must enable vCD Guest Customization on the RECOVERY page. Click NEXT . The System Service Profile does not permit Backup Services, so click NEXT again. In the SUMMARY page, review the options you have selected for the VPG and click DONE to create the VPG. Creating a virtual protection group in Zerto Virtual Manager (Disaster Recovery as a Service and Migration to the Cloud) If you're creating a VPG for Disaster Recovery as a Service or Migration to the Cloud, use the ZVM Web Client in your local environment. When you create the VPG, you specify the individual VMs that you want to protect or migrate. Log in to the ZVM Web Client. Select the VPGs tab and then click NEW VPG . On the NEW VPG page of the Create VPG dialog, specify the VPG Name . From the Priority list, choose the priority of transferring data from the source site to the target site for this VPG when there is limited bandwidth and more than one VPG is defined on the source site. High - Updates from VPGs with high priority are passed over the WAN first Medium - Updates from VPGs with medium priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the high priority VPGs have used it Low - Updates from VPGs with low priority use whatever bandwidth is left after the medium VPGs have used it Click NEXT . On the VMs page, select the VMs that you want to protect or migrate and then click NEXT . On the REPLICATION tab, from the Recovery Site list, choose your UKCloud target site. From the Recovery Org vDC list, choose the VDC in which you want to replicate the VMs. UKCloud provides a single Service Profile : System Service Profile . Click NEXT .

If you need any assistance with the upgrade process, contact the support team by raising a service request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. We highly recommend that you upgrade your edge gateways to 6.2. x so that you can then convert them to advanced gateways. Upgrading to 6.2. x also fixes known issues with TcpUdp firewall rules. Note You must upgrade all edge gateways to 6.2. x prior to our planned upgrade to vCloud Director 9.1. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. Prerequisites Before you attempt to upgrade your edge gateway, check for the following. Check current version To check the existing version of your edge gateway: Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the appropriate account. Click My VMs . Select the compute service (vOrg) that the edge gateway belongs to. Select the My VMs tab. From the Currently viewing for VDC list, select the VDC that the edge gateway you want to check belongs to. Select the Edge Gateway tab. From the Select Edge list, select the edge gateway that you want to check. The VM version field shows the version number of your edge gateway. If the version is lower than 6.2.7 (for example, 5.5.4), make a note that the edge gateway needs upgrading. Repeat these steps for any other edge gateways that you want to check. Load balancers with weight of 0 In the NSX API in vCloud Director 8.20, using a load balancer weight of 0 to disable a member is no longer valid. If you attempt to upgrade an edge gateway with a load balancer member weight of 0, the redeployment will fail. For more information, see the following VMware Knowledge Base article: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/51724 . To resolve this issue, before you upgrade your edge gateway, set the load balancer member weight to 1. In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Double-click the VDC that the edge gateway that you want to edit belongs to (or right-click the VDC and select Open ). Select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway that you want to edit and select Edge Gateway Services . Select the Load Balancer tab. Select the load balancer you want to edit and click Edit . Select the Manage Members tab. Select the load balancer member that you want to edit and click Edit . In the Ratio weight field, enter 1 . After you've upgraded the edge gateway, we recommend that you convert it to an advanced gateway, where you can then disable the load balancer member. Important Before you convert your edge gateway, read How to convert your edge to an advanced gateway for important known issues relating to APIs, disabling firewalls and firewall rule keywords. Upgrading your edge gateway to the latest available version The following steps show how to upgrade your edge gateway using vCloud Director. Note Before you begin the upgrade process, bear in mind that there will be a brief network disruption for the networks that are used by the edge gateway instance. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed steps, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the appropriate account. Click My VMs . Select the compute service (vOrg) that the edge gateway belongs to. Select the vCloud Director tab, enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Confirm . In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Double-click the VDC that the edge gateway that you want to upgrade belongs to (or right-click the VDC and select Open ). Select the Edge Gateways tab. Right-click the edge gateway that you want to upgrade and select Re-Deploy . In the confirmation dialog box, click Yes . Important This step requires downtime as a new VM needs to be deployed for the edge gateway. You should make sure that you have planned for this downtime before proceeding. You can monitor the status in the Activity Task Detail dialog box. After the redeployment has finished, you can check the version of the edge gateway again in the UKCloud Portal to confirm that the upgrade has been successful. Next steps We recommend that you convert your edge gateway to an advanced gateway to take advantage of more features and to access the new HTML5-based tenant portal.

    "title": "How to license Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to licence Microsoft applications/software on the UKCloud platform Overview Important It is your responsibility to ensure that you have a valid licence for any software installed on the UKCloud platform if applicable. This guide is designed to provide information on how Microsoft licensing can be applied on our platform and the options available to you. UKCloud offer two ways to licence Microsoft software for use on our compute platform, providing you with the flexibility you need to deliver your application workloads in line with Microsoft requirements and obligations. These are for UKCloud to purchase these licences monthly for you, or for you to submit a Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification form if you intend to use your own existing licensing. Microsoft Server licensing To make the provisioning of Microsoft-based virtual machines (VMs) as simple and quick as possible, while remaining in line with our Microsoft agreement, all Microsoft Server licences must be provided by UKCloud. The standard licensing approach is for us to provide Microsoft Windows Server licences on a per hour basis. This is retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM. Please note that it is not possible for you to bring your own Microsoft Windows Server licences for use on the UKCloud platform. For your Microsoft Windows Server‑based VMs to use a UKCloud-purchased licence, you must create all your Microsoft VMs using a Microsoft template from the UKCloud product catalogue. If you prefer to create your Microsoft VMs using your own template, you must then register these VMs with our Key Management Server (KMS). A document is available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre to explain how this is done. The Microsoft Windows Server licence is invoiced each month, in addition to the cost of the VM, based on the VM's usage. We automatically bill the usage of Microsoft Windows Server per hour that the VM is powered on, and invoice you for your consumption of Microsoft Windows Server per month using the following pricing table for G-Cloud 10: VM size SPLA Per hour per VM Academic Per hour per VM Micro, Tiny VM £0.012 £0.002 Small VM £0.023 £0.003 Medium VM, Medium High Memory £0.046 £0.007 Large VM, Large High Memory, Tier One Apps £0.135 £0.020 Due to the elimination of the discount for G-SPLA, there is now price parity with corporate SPLA. As a result, customers who may not have previously been applicable for G-SPLA are not impacted. Microsoft desktop licensing It is not currently possible for you to use Microsoft desktop operating systems on the UKCloud platform. This includes both your own licensing or via UKCloud. However, it is possible for you to bring your own Microsoft desktop licensing for use on a dedicated cloud server such as Private Cloud for Compute. In this instance, please contact your Account Director or your Technical Account Manager for further information. Options for all other Microsoft applications As stated, all Microsoft applications on the UKCloud platform must be licensed appropriately by either UKCloud or by using your own existing licensing. There are two options available to you: UKCloud's Microsoft licensing and usage billing. The standard licensing approach is for us to provide Microsoft licences on a per hour or monthly basis depending on the application. These are retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM for each month. For this option to be valid, you must ensure that you have informed us of all Microsoft installations by raising a Service Request via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal, detailing the VM names, the application and specific version/level. Please note that not all applications are available using this option, and the Microsoft application list within this document will state the eligibility of this option per application. Bring your own Microsoft licensing. If your organisation has an existing SPLA or Academic licensing contract with Microsoft, or if you wish to licence your Microsoft software directly, we can offer the option of your organisation using your own Microsoft software licensing. Note This is only possible with certain Microsoft applications and is not possible for Microsoft Windows Server as stated above. Before you install any Microsoft software onto a UKCloud VM, you must ensure that you purchase the correct licensing with software assurance and that you have completed the Microsoft Licence Mobility Verification process detailed in this document. The completion of the process is identified by a signed confirmation sent to you from Microsoft Ireland. Please note that if you do not have software assurance, you will not be able to use the Microsoft Mobility option. The Microsoft Mobility option involves transferring the use of your licensing to UKCloud VMs, and therefore they cannot be used on other Cloud Service Providers or on your own hardware. However, if you discontinue the use of the application on the UKCloud platform and no longer require the licensing, this can be reverted for your use elsewhere. The Microsoft Mobility form and guide are available on the UKCloud Knowledge Centre. Please note that this must be completed and posted to Microsoft and not to UKCloud. The correct UKCloud partner agreement number to use is 8392716. Microsoft application list The following list is aimed at providing you with a summary regarding the licensing options available to you for each specific application. This summary states whether UKCloud licensing and/or Microsoft Mobility is available. Please note that this is not intended to be a complete list, but covers the most frequently requested applications. If the application you are looking for is not on this list, please engage with your Account Director or Technical Account Manager who will be able to help and advise you as to whether the software can be licensed and if so how. Microsoft SQL You do not need to purchase licensing for MySQL, SQL Express or PostgreSQL. However, if you are using SQL Standard or Enterprise for development purposes you are required by Microsoft to have valid licensing in place. SQL Developer can only be utilised on a shared platform to test the SQL element of a solution and cannot be used to provide end-user services. If you wish to provide SQL services to end-users, SQL Enterprise or SQL Standard must be purchased. We can provide Microsoft SQL Standard Server licences on a per hour basis, or Microsoft SQL Enterprise licences billed on a monthly basis. These are retrospectively billed based on your usage of an associated VM, and the pricing is available within the G9 Service definitions and pricing guide. Microsoft Mobility - this is a valid option for both SQL Standard and Enterprise. Please note that for under SPLA licensing you only need to purchase the SQL server licence and you do not need to purchase Server Access Licences (SAL). Remote Desktop Server Access Licence UKCloud licensing - we are able to provide Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDS) SAL on a monthly basis only. These are retrospectively billed, and the pricing is available within the G10 Service definitions and pricing guide. For these licences to be used, you must raise a service request prior to their use as they will need to be registered on the UKCloud platform and will need to provision a dedicated RDS licence server. To assign and validate the licences, we will need to arrange a session to connect to your server. Microsoft Mobility - this is a valid option for RDS licences. System Center UKCloud licensing - we are currently unable to offer this as standard or at an additional cost due to our current Microsoft Windows Server licences. Microsoft Mobility - as per Microsoft's terms, you can use your own licensing to cover this software as long as you have active software assurance in place. If you have System Center Datacentre licensing in place this can be used on up to 10 VMs on the UKCloud platform. However, if you own a standard licence, this only covers 2 VMs. The licence can be used for High Availability, Disaster Recovery Solutions and vMotion events giving you full autonomy to design solutions with resilience in mind whilst being fully licensed. SharePoint UKCloud licensing - we are not currently able to offer licences for this application. Microsoft Mobility - Sharepoint Server or Sharepoint Server for internet sites can be licensed through Licence Mobility, only if Software Assurance is in place. Once verified by Microsoft you will be able to use the SharePoint software on the UKCloud platform. Office UKCloud licensing - UKCloud can offer SALs for this software. You need to inform us as to how many users will be accessing the application and we will bill you on a per user, per month basis. This pricing is available on request as it is not currently stated in the G9 service definitions or pricing guide. Microsoft Mobility - this is not available via Microsoft Mobility and must be provided by UKCloud. Visual Studio UKCloud licensing - UKCloud can offer licensing for this software. You need to tell us how many users will be accessing the software and we will bill you on a per user, per month basis. Please note the only versions of Visual Studio permitted by Microsoft are Enterprise and Professional. Microsoft Mobility - this is not available via Microsoft Mobility and must be provided by UKCloud. Other Microsoft Products Please engage with your Account Director or Technical Account Manager who will be able to help and advise you as to whether the software can be licensed, and if so, how. Submitting a request to use Microsoft applications on the UKCloud platform You must advise us of your preferred method for licensing Microsoft applications. To use your existing Microsoft licensing or use licences billed by us on UKCloud‑provisioned VMs: Log in to the UKCloud Portal . Select Support , then My Calls . Select Raise a new Support Call . From the How can we help you? list, select I am requesting information on/administration of my service . From the Select Product list, select Enterprise Compute Cloud (vCloud/VMware) From the What is the nature of your query? list, select either: I want UKCloud to invoice me for the licensing of Microsoft software on one or more VMs . I want to bring my own Microsoft licences to my UKCloud environment Once you have selected one of the two options above, you will need to fill out a Request summary and provide the information outlined below: If you have selected I want to bring my own Microsoft licences to my UKCloud environment, you need to state the specific VDC and VMs that contain the software that will be affected by your own licensing. You will also need to state what software, version, and the quantity of licences you will be using. (You must have completed the Microsoft Mobility verification process before choosing this option.) If your Microsoft Mobility application has been accepted, you need to inform us of the date from which your licensing will take effect. If you have selected I want UKCloud to invoice me for the licensing of Microsoft software on one or more VMs , you need to state the specific VDC and VMs that contain the software you wish UKCloud to licence for you. You will also need to state what software licenses, version, the quantity you require, and the date from which you wish the licensing to commence. Note It is your responsibility to inform support when you no longer require the licensing on one or more of the specified VMs. Click Submit . Validation If you request to use your own licensing, let us know when you have submitted the Mobility Verification form and the support team will update our records. As soon as Microsoft confirm with us that the licences are available, your own Microsoft licensing will be utilised. If you were previously using UKCloud-provided SQL licensing, this will be stopped and you will no longer be billed by us for SQL. Microsoft may contact you to confirm that you have the correct number of licences in place to cover the number of Microsoft-based provisioned VMs supplied by UKCloud. Microsoft SQL Server images To install Microsoft SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition, you can either use your own local images, or we can make an image available to you. To gain access to any images, you must either inform us so that we can bill you for the appropriate usage, or wait until we've received confirmation from Microsoft as per the mobility process. You can request access to images by raising a Service Request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. Responsibilities As soon as you have completed the form and the actions have been confirmed, your organisation is responsible for ensuring that there are enough eligible licences to cover the specified Microsoft-based VMs on the UKCloud platform. Support If you have any issues regarding updating, or the support of Microsoft Server, please contact the UKCloud support team by raising a Service Request.

As of July 2015, UKCloud implemented an RHUI to provide automatic updates to our Red Hat customers on our Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL platforms. This provides benefits such as the reliable availability of patch updates and Red Hat approved OS templates. This update service replaces the previous repositories, which are no longer updated and were retired on the 31 August 2015. Pre-requisites There are two pre-requisites for performing this operation: The host can resolve the following DNS records: Assured: 37.26.90.194 rhua.ukcloud.com Elevated: 172.26.89.98 rhua.psn.ukcloud.com You can achieve this by configuring an A record on your local DNS, or configuring a /etc/hosts file with one of the lines above. All hosts using the service must be able to access the local RHUA server on port 443 (HTTPS). Ensure that you have configured SNAT and firewall policies on your edge gateway device. If you have any questions on this, contact UKCloud Support. Installation You can find the installer RPM files in the UKCloud public catalog under media , for example, UKCloud-RHUI-Standard-Assured . If you require the high availability (HA) package, raise a Service Request directly via the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal and it will be uploaded to your private catalogue. Mount the UKCloud RHUI-***.iso to the VM (or place the contents in an accessible location such as NFS share, FTP, and so on). Install the relevant RPM. For example, for RHEL6: rpm -ivh IL2-Client-RHEL6-Standard-2.0-1.noarch.rpm . If you are installing a new RPM, such as replacing standard with HA you need to use the -force flag to overwrite the existing certificates. Clean yum: yum clean all Test the RHUI is working: yum update The first time you update from RHUI you will be prompted to accept the following two certificates: The Red Hat entitlement certificate The Client entitlement certificate Troubleshooting The primary issues you may encounter are: DNS Failure Check the DNS lookup is working and you have the correct entry for Assured and Elevated. 443 not accessible Check your firewall configuration, including local firewalls ( iptables ) and edge gateway. Ensure you have the correct destination IP entry for Assured or Elevated. Incorrect version Ensure you have installed the correct RPM for your release.

    "title": "How to install and configure OpenVPN | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to install and configure OpenVPN Overview Secure remote access to the cloud is essential to cloud adoption and use. UKCloud for VMware comes with a dedicated edge gateway, providing a simple and easy-to-use solution that supports IPsec site-to-site virtual private networks (VPNs) and a limited number of remote access client VPNs designed for occasional use. If you require a more flexible or scalable solution, you can deploy your own choice of virtual appliances (either open-source solutions, such as OpenVPN or commercial solutions from a supplier, such as Cisco, F5 or Palo Alto), instead of using the limited VPN service provided with the default edge gateway. This article details the steps required to obtain, deploy and configure an OpenVPN virtual appliance to obtain remote access to your virtual data centres (VDCs) running on the UKCloud platform. Note OpenVPN is a licensed product. Without a licence key, you are limited to only two concurrent VPN connections. If you require additional concurrent connections, you'll need to obtain and install a licence key. Preparing your virtual data centre To secure your environment, we recommend that you deploy the OpenVPN appliance into a new, routed VDC network. Ideally, no other virtual machines (VMs) should connect to this network. This enables you to tightly control access from VPN clients to the VMs in your environment using firewall rules on the edge gateway. However, if you're approaching the network interface limit of your edge gateway, it's possible to deploy the OpenVPN appliance into an existing network. Create a new VDC network Using the HTML5 tenant portal in vCloud Director 9.1 In vCloud Director, go to the VDC and in the Network section, click Add . Fill in the required fields and select the edge to route through. Provide a gateway, subnet mask and DNS. Create a static pool in the format of: 192.168.1.2-192.168.1.100 and click Add . When you're done, click Save . Using the Flex-based UI in vCloud Director 8.20 To create a new VDC network: In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Right-click your VDC and select Open , then select the Org VDC Networks tab. Click the green plus icon. On the Select Network Type page of the New Organization VDC Network dialog box, select Create a routed network . Provide the network addressing information requested in the rest of the dialog box and then click Finish . More information! How to create a routed VDC network Configuring the edge gateway After you've created the network, you'll need to configure the edge gateway to control access to the VMs in your environment. To configure the edge gateway: In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Right-click your VDC and select Open , then select the Edge Gateways tab Right-click your gateway and select Edge Gateway Services . To control access to your VMs, you should create the following: A source NAT rule to allow the OpenVPN appliance outbound access to the internet. A destination NAT rule to allow inbound access from the internet to the OpenVPN appliance. A firewall rule to allow inbound access from the internet on port 443 . One or more firewall rules to allow users connected to the OpenVPN appliance to access VMs on other networks for administration purposes. Note All VPN users will be NATed to the IP address of the OpenVPN appliance. One or more firewall rules to allow access from trusted environments to the OpenVPN appliance on the admin port (port 943 by default, but can be changed) More information! How to create firewall rules and How to create NAT rules Obtaining the latest OpenVPN appliance To ensure you're running the latest release of OpenVPN, we recommend that you download the latest version of the appliance directly from the OpenVPN website: Go to the following location to download the latest OVA file: https://swupdate.openvpn.org/appliances/AS2.ova In vCloud Director, select the Catalogs tab. In the left navigation panel, select My Organization's Catalogs . Open the catalog you'd like to add the appliance to, or create a new catalog. Click the Upload button and upload the OVA file to the catalog. Deploying the OpenVPN appliance Using the HTML5 tenant portal in vCloud Director 9.1 To deploy the OpenVPN appliance: In vCloud Director, go to your VDC and select vApps . Click Add vApp from OVF . Select the OVA that you downloaded then click Next . Review the details of the OVA to confirm that it's the right images then click Next . The appliance will be deployed as a single VM inside a vApp. Provide a name for the vApp then click Next . Provide a valid NetBIOS host name and your desired storage policy then click Next . Configure the network by selecting Switch to advanced networking workflow . Select the network adapter type, network and IP pool assignment ( Manual ) then click Next . Select the number of vCPUs, sockets and memory this appliance will have then click Next . Review the details then click Finish to deploy the vApp and appliance. When the vApp has deployed and is powered on, you'll need to reset (reboot) the VM before logging in for the first time to force the networking changes made during VMWare's guest customisations to take effect before you start configuring OpenVPN. Using the Flex-based UI in vCloud Director 8.20 To deploy the OpenVPN appliance: In vCloud Director, select the My Cloud tab. In the left navigation panel, select vApps . In the toolbar, click the Add vApp from OVF icon. In the Add vApp from OVF wizard, on the Select Source page, select Local file and browse to the OVA file that you downloaded, then click Next . The appliance will be deployed as a single VM inside the vApp. On the Review Details page, confirm the details of the OVA file and then click Next On the Select Name and Location page, enter a meaningful Name and Description for your vApp From the Virtual Datacenter list, select the VDC in which you want to create the vApp and then click Next . On the Configure Resources page, select your desired storage policy and then click Next . On the Configure Networking page, provide a name for the VM. Select the Switch to the advanced networking workflow check box. This enables you to select your desired network and change the IP assignment method. Typically, we recommend that you deploy the VPN appliance to its own network segment (as described in Preparing your virtual data centre , and use the Static IP Pool method of IP assignment. Continue through the wizard and click Finish . There are no further changes necessary unless you want to customise the vApp further to suit your environment. When the vApp has deployed and is powered on, you'll need to reset (reboot) the VM before logging in for the first time to force the networking changes made during VMWare's guest customisations to take effect before you start configuring OpenVPN. Performing initial configuration To perform initial configuration: In vCloud Director, right-click your OpenVPN VM and select Popout Console . Log in to the VM as the root user. Tip To obtain the root password, right-click the VM, select Properties , click the Guest OS Customization tab and make a note of the password. You'll be prompted to answer a series of questions: Licence agreement: --- Enter yes to accept. Will this be the primary Access Server node? --- Enter yes . Please specify the network interface and IP address to be used by the Admin Web UI -- If the guest customisations were applied correctly, this should default to eth0 , which should be configured with an IP address on the network you selected during deployment. Please specify the port number for the Admin Web UI --- Enter your desired port number, or accept the default of 943 . A separate port is not strictly needed for administration but is recommended. Please specify the TCP port number for the OpenVPN Daemon --- We recommend that you use the default of 443 where possible as the use of a non-standard port may cause problems when connecting from corporate networks. Should client traffic be routed by default through VPN? --- Entering yes will prevent your client device from accessing any other networks (for example, your corporate network) while the VPN is connected. For ease of use, we suggest you answer no to this question. Should client DNS traffic be routed by default through the VPN? --- If you answered yes to the previous question, all traffic will be routed through the VPN anyway, so your answer here will not matter. If you answered no to the previous question, you'll probably want to answer no to this question so that your DNS queries are answered by the usual servers. Use local authentication via internal DB? --- Enter yes unless you want to authenticate users from an existing directory service (Active Directory/LDAP). Should private subnets be accessible to clients by default? --- Answer yes to enable access to your cloud networks via the VPN. Do you wish to login to the Admin UI as \"openvpn\"? --- Answer yes to create a local user account named openvpn . If you answer no , you'll need to set up a different user name and password. Please specify your OpenVPN-AS license key --- If you've purchased a licence, enter the licence key, otherwise leave this blank. When you've completed the setup wizard, you'll need to create user accounts and passwords on the local operating system (unless you configured an LDAP directory). If you opted to use the default openvpn account, you'll need to configure its password: #passwd openvpn Press ^D to log off the console, but before you do so, there are some additional system configurations, detailed in the following sections, that you might want to perform while you're connected to the console. Check the DNS resolver configuration is in place During our tests, the DNS resolver configuration was not added by the VMware customisations. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/network/interfaces Use the arrow keys to scroll down. Below the line specifying the default gateway, add the following: dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 Press ^O to save the file, then ^X to exit the text editor. Restart the networking service for the change to take effect: # service networking restart Configure the keyboard The default configuration is for a US keyboard. To reconfigure for UK: Enter the following command: # dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration Step through the wizard. There's no need to restart anything when you're finished. Apply updates It's a good idea to apply the latest upgrades to the system. Enter the following command: # apt-get update && apt-get upgrade You'll be prompted to approve the installation of any updates. Install NTP Installing NTP is good practice anyway, but is required if you intend to use two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator. Enter the following command: # apt-get install ntp When the installation is complete, update the configuration file to point to UKCloud's NTP servers. # pico /etc/ntp.config Use the arrow keys to scroll down until you reach the lines beginning with server . Change the first two lines to reflect the UKCloud servers, and comment out the remaining two lines: Server 37.26.90.192 Server 37.26.94.232 Configuring administration options To configure administration options: Log on to the admin interface at: https://<ip_address>/admin To set the hostname, under Configuration , select Server Network Settings and then set the Hostname or IP Address to either a public IP address or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that your client will be able to resolve. Save the settings on this page. Under Configuration , select VPN settings and, in the Routing section, add any additional subnets that your VPN users should have access to. These will usually be the IP subnets configured on all of your VDC networks. This is the minimum configuration required to be able to establish a VPN connection. If you want to create new user accounts, under User Management , select User Permissions . You can configure the password for each account by clicking the Show link in the More Settings column. Note Be sure to use complex passwords. Logging in and connecting You can download the VPN client software and connection profiles directly from the appliance by browsing to the following location and logging in with a valid user name and password: https://<ip_address>/ The downloaded client software and profile includes the client certificate that is required for authentication. When you've installed the client software or profile, you can initiate connections directly from the client. Securing the appliance We strongly recommend that you further secure the appliance by making the changes suggested in the following sections. Change all default passwords If you've not already done so, change the root password to something more secure. Log in to the OpenVPN VM console as the root user. Enter the following command: # passwd Lock down unused ports with iptables The OpenVPN configuration utility adds the required ALLOW entries to iptables automatically. To deny all other traffic, enter the following command: # iptables -A INPUT -j DROP Enable two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator You can enable two-factor authentication via the OpenVPN administration interface. Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https://<ip_address>/admin Under Configuration , select Client Settings then click the checkbox to enable Google Authenticator support. Note Users will need to enter or scan the Google Authenticator secret by logging into the client portal ( http://<ip_address>/ ). When they've configured the secret, they should click the I scanned the QR code button to enforce two-factor authentication. Lock down the Admin Web UI and Client Web UI By default, both Admin and Client UIs are accessible over port 443 . This can pose a security risk if you've opened port 443 to the internet to allow users to connect from anywhere. Besides the obvious risk of unauthorised access to the administration interface, should an attacker gain access to the client interface, they'll be able to download the client certificates necessary to establish a VPN connection. You can limit the administration and client interfaces so that they are accessible only via the administration port number ( 943 by default). This enables you to restrict access to this port to a trusted IP address or network, while allowing VPN access on port 443 from anywhere. Your users will need to log in initially from the trusted network to install the client software, client certificate and configure Google Authenticator, before being able to establish VPN access. To lock down the administration and client interfaces: Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https://<ip_address>/admin Under Configuration , select Server Network Settings . Under Service Forwarding in the VPN Server section, clear the check boxes for Admin Web Server and Client Web Server . Disable root SSH login If connecting via SSH, it's best practice to connect with a non-privileged account, then sudo to root if needed. This prevents an attacker from brute-forcing the root password. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/ssh/sshd\\_config Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file, and change the PermitRootLogin to no . Disable the default account During the initial setup, you created an user name and password to log in to the administration interface. This account, with the name openvpn , is configured to be always active, disregarding its status in the User Permissions area. In addition, if you configured two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator, this is not enforced for the default account. To disable the default account: Enter the following command: # pico /usr/local/openvpn_as/etc/as.conf Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file until you see entries starting with boot_pam_users . Comment out the entry for the user name you chose for the default account. Usually this is the boot_pam_users.0= entry. Restart the OpenVPN service for the change to take effect: # service restart openvpnas More help If you have any issues regarding the updating or support of Microsoft Server, contact the UKCloud support team by raising a Service Request.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for Email and Collaboration as a Service | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Email and Collaboration as a Service Overview UKCloud offers an Email and Collaboration service, powered by Zimbra, to enable you to have a cloud hosted, secure email service, connected to government networks or the internet. You can connect this mail service through you normal mail applications (for example, Microsoft Outlook), to send and receive mail as well as use lightweight collaborative features. This Getting Started Guide walks you through the process of configuring your Email and Collaboration service. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to set up their Email and Collaboration as a Service. To complete the steps in this guide you must have login credentials for an administrator account and access to the Zimbra administration console. Introduction to Email and Collaboration as a Service The Zimbra Collaboration Suite that underpins UKCloud's email offering provides a wide range of client connectivity options. An advanced webmail client allows the full feature set within the suite to be accessed from anywhere that internet connectivity is available and from virtually any platform via a wide-range of supported browsers A cross-platform desktop application is provided extending the functionality of the web client by enabling email to be read and composed while offline IMAP and POP3 clients are supported Calendar and contacts can be accessed via the CalDav and CardDav protocols Full Microsoft Outlook integration is supported using the Zimbra Collaboration Suite Connector for Outlook, which utilizes a full MAPI provider that leverages the Microsoft-standard MAPI interface for contacts, calendar, and other functionality not supported by IMAP or POP The service provides enterprise-class functionality for end-users, on a per-mailbox, per- month pricing model. It offers several options for mailbox access, including POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP --- all with TLS (SSL) encryption --- as well as HTTPS. Exchange ActiveSync is also supported. Although the service was designed with end-users in mind, there's nothing to stop you using the supported protocols to allow an application to access a mailbox in order to send or receive email. This will generally be achieved via SMTP or POP3 over TLS. It's worth noting that there's a minimum commitment of 25 mailboxes with this service --- but they don't all have to be used. Before you begin To start using the Email and Collaboration service, you first need to decide on a domain name, which must be a real-world, registered domain name. You can use a new domain name, or simply delegate a sub-domain of your organisation's existing domain name. You'll need to configure your chosen domain's MX record as mail.skyscapecs.net . Once you've decided on a domain name and submitted your service request, UKCloud will configure your domain name on our platform and create an administrator account. You'll receive a welcome email with details of your administrator account with delegated rights for your email domain. This account will usually be in the following format: admin@ yourdomain For example: admin@example.com You'll receive the account details as part of the onboarding process; we recommend that you change the account's password immediately. This is the account you'll use to create mailboxes on the platform. You'll need to create a mailbox for each email address you want to be able to send or receive from. Supported browsers Refer to the Zimbra Collaboration Supported Systems document for the most up to date list, at: https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.7.0/Supported_Systems Firefox and Chrome on Windows, Mac, Linux Internet Explorer on Windows Safari on Mac and Windows Accessing the Zimbra administration console The Zimbra administration console is a browser-based user interface for managing your mailbox server and mailbox accounts. The way you access the administration console depends on which security domain you use: The Assured OFFICIAL console is accessible from the internet or via the PSN Assured network (depending on the service selected) The Elevated OFFICIAL console is accessible only via the PSN Protected network (and other interconnecting networks) We'll provide you with the URL for the administration console along with your account details. Creating a user account Creating a user account sets up the appropriate entries in the LDAP directory server. When the user logs in for the first time, or when the first email is delivered to the user's account, the mailbox is created on the mailbox server. To create a user account: In the administration console, select Manage and then Accounts . Click the gear symbol in the top-right of the main panel and select New . Enter an Account name and the user's Last name . (The other fields are optional.) If the new account will be an administrator, select the Administrator checkbox in the Account Setup section. Scroll down to set the initial Password then click Next . Enter the new user's contact information then click Next . Enter any aliases required for the account then click Next . Add the account to any required distribution lists then click Next . If the account is an administrator account, you need to add it to the administration group at this point, to grant the necessary rights within the domain. To do this: In the Find field under Add distribution lists to the account , enter admingroup and click Search . Select the resulting admingroup@yourdomain . Click Add at the bottom of the dialog box to make the new account a member of the group. Specify any forwarding rules. Click Finish to complete creation of the account. The user can log in to and use the account immediately. It will take up to an hour to add the account to the Global Address List, during which time the account name won't be listed as an auto-complete option for users composing emails. Getting to know the Zimbra web client Zimbra offers standard HTML, advanced JavaScript, and mobile web clients that you can log into. The web clients include mail, calendar, address book, and task functionality. You can select the client to use when you log in. The advanced web client includes Ajax capability and offers a full set of web collaboration features. This web client works best with newer browsers and fast internet connections. The standard web client is a good option when internet connections are slow or if you prefer HTML-based messaging for navigating within your mailbox. The mobile web client provides an experience optimized for smaller screen formats available on mobile devices. Typically when you log in, you'll see the advanced Zimbra web client. You can switch to a different version if you prefer by using the Version list on the login screen. If the Zimbra web client detects that the screen resolution is 800x600, you're automatically redirected to the standard web client. You can still select the advanced web client but will see a warning message suggesting the use of the standard client for a better screen view. When connecting to Zimbra using a mobile web browser, Zimbra will automatically detect and default to the mobile web client. To access the Zimbra web client: Go to the following location: https://mail.skyscapecs.net/ Log in using your account's email address and password. Installing the Zimbra desktop client The Zimbra desktop client delivers a consistent user experience offline, so email, social media, calendar, contacts, files and documents are synchronized and locally accessible when on the road. Zimbra Desktop aggregates information across accounts (Zimbra, Yahoo! Mail, Gmail, Hotmail, etc.) and social networks (Facebook, Digg, Twitter, etc.) to help make communicating and sharing information easier than ever. Download Zimbra Desktop from: https://www.zimbra.com/downloads/zimbra-desktop/ Note The desktop client is supported on Windows, Mac and Linux. Once installed open the client and click the Add New Account button. From the Account Type list, select Zimbra and complete the form as shown in the image below, substituting the Email Address and Password with your account details. When you're done, click Validate and Save . The new account will be listed. Click Launch Desktop . Configuring IMAP and POP3 clients A wide variety of IMAP and POP3 clients are available natively, or for download and use within Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and BlackBerry. There are far too many to cover in detail so examples of setting up the more common desktop applications will be detailed here. The following settings should work with any application that adheres to the IMAP or POP3 protocol standards. IMAP is the preferred protocol and should be used if available. Incoming mail server (IMAP): mail.skyscapecs.net Encrypted connection type: SSL IMAP/S port: 993 Incoming mail server (POP3): mail.skyscapecs.net Encrypted connection type: SSL POP3/S port: 995 Outgoing mail server (SMTP): mail.skyscapecs.net Encrypted connection type: SSL/TLS SMTP/S port: 465 Configuring Microsoft Outlook To configure Outlook: In Outlook, select File then Add Account .

This can be referred to as an electronic mailshot. IMAP The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a mail protocol used for accessing email on a remote web server from a local client. LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an Internet protocol that email and other programs use to look up information from a server. LDAP is mostly used by medium-to-large organisations. POP POP stands for Post Office Protocol. POP3 is version 3 of the protocol. When an e-mail is sent to your address, it is stored on the mail server until it is downloaded via your e-mail client (Outlook, your mobile, etc.) using POP3. After the e-mail has been downloaded to your client, it is removed from the server altogether. SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is used when email is delivered from an email client, such as Outlook Express, to an email server or when email is delivered from one email server to another. SMTP uses port 25. TLS Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), both frequently referred to as \"SSL\", are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network. Zimbra An enterprise-class email, calendar and collaboration solution built for the cloud, both public and private.

    "keywords": "Cloud Storage Service Scope About this document This document describes the boundaries of the Cloud Storage service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About Cloud Storage Cloud Storage from UKCloud is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. As an object storage platform based on Dell EMC's Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), it is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Service options Organisations can choose from two service levels: STANDARD - data is stored in a single named UK-sovereign data centre with data protection using erasure coding. This provides fault tolerance by storing three copies of the data across separate nodes, thus improving data durability. ENHANCED - data is stored in two UK-sovereign data centres, with a copy maintained in a primary named UK data centre and copied to a geographically remote UK data centre. This provides a greater degree of fault tolerance than the STANDARD service level by storing an additional copy of the data in a separate site. If you want more control and visibility of your disaster recovery solution, you can design your solution to write data independently to each data centre at our STANDARD service level, instead of using our ENHANCED service level. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition ( Assured | Elevated ). Service availability UKCloud platform availability is based on the service level you purchase. The service level agreement (SLA) for the STANDARD service level guarantees 99.95% availability. The ENHANCED service level SLA guarantees 99.99% availability. In the event of a site failure, there will be an outage to objects created on the failed site. UKCloud will bring these objects online in the other site within 15 minutes. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition . Service background We actively capacity-manage the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned. We will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Platform management Users can access, manage and view their Cloud Storage service, in any of the following ways: APIs. You can use either the ECS S3-compatible API or the ECS Atmos API. The APIs are not interchangeable, so you need to choose carefully which API you want to use. Refer to the EMC ECS Data Access Guide for more information on the features of both APIs. Command Line Interface (CLI). CLI tools enable access from the command line by translating commands into the relevant API calls. Storage Gateways. These applications can interact with Cloud Storage via the native API on the back-end and translate it into a more traditional file or block storage protocol at the front-end, enabling a wide variety of use cases. See Blueprint -- Using Storage Gateways with Cloud Storage for more information. UKCloud Portal. Contains information about the namespaces and users within your Cloud Storage environment, as well as a graphical representation of your storage consumption. For more information on the Portal functionality, see How to view Cloud Storage information in the UKCloud Portal . To create additional namespaces or users, you must raise a service request. When requesting additional users, you can specify whether you want these users to have read-write or read-only permissions. We do not currently offer access as an NFS or a HDFS. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the ECS Portal. Protection You can protect against accidental deletion or modification of data by using retention policies or versioning. Retention policies add a layer of protection by preventing files from being modified or deleted for a specified period of time, making them best suited to static data. Retention policies cannot be applied at the object level -- these API requests will be rejected. Versioning can protect against accidental deletion and modification by keeping multiple variants of an object. When versioning is enabled, any operation that would have overwritten an object retains the old version of the object, enabling you to retrieve or restore to a previous version using the S3 API. Each version of an object will be billable for the storage it consumes, so you may want to implement versioning expiration policies to manage your storage footprint. Encryption at rest can be enabled when creating a new namespace or bucket. This encrypts data inline, using an AES 256-bit algorithm, before it is stored on drives. If you want your data to be encrypted at the namespace level, you must request this functionality before your namespace is created, as encryption cannot be enabled or disabled after a namespace is created. Networks Cloud Storage is available on a range of Assured and Elevated networks. An overview of the available networks in each region is available in UKCloud Services By Region . Cloud Storage in our Assured OFFICAL domain uses the same environment for both PSN Assured and internet connections. Although it isn't possible to bridge between these connections, any objects placed in Cloud Storage via PSN Assured will also be accessible via the internet using the appropriate customer credentials. We manage the physical firewalls that face public and secure networks. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the perimeter of your estate. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services within your estate - it is your responsibility to act at this level. In line with UKCloud's SISP, we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Service migration You can request a migration through a Service Request. Migrations may be between: Services (for example, STANDARD to ENHANCED) UKCloud sites or availability zones The Assured and Elevated platforms Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud Customer Success Manager, who will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud Cloud Storage service, including finding relevant systems and using UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing complex solutions. Technical Account Managers (TAM). You will be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Engagement Factsheet . Customer responsibilities Assessing whether the UKCloud platform can support the various requirements of your application and storage needs. The control and management of access and responsibilities for end users including appropriate connectivity, security and accreditation if required. If access is required over government secure networks (N3/HSCN, Janet, RLI or PSN), the customer is responsible for adhering to the relevant Code of Connection (CoCo) and for providing evidence of their CoCo to UKCloud upon request. UKCloud is unable to provide access to secure networks where such evidence has not been provided by the customer. The customer is also responsible for ensuring only lawful data that supports the UK public sector is stored and processed by applications on this environment, and that they fully comply with the UKCloud Security Operating Procedures (SyOPs) and other information assurance requirements as specified in the UKCloud System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP) and associated accreditation documentation sets. Service provisioning Within 1 day of accepting an order (shorter deployment times are typically achieved and can be prioritised upon request), UKCloud will create the customer's Primary Administrator account and send a Welcome Pack which includes the URL for the UKCloud Customer Portal, and the getting started guide. The customer can then use these details to configure their application (for example GeoDrive, CIFS-ECS, Cloud Tiering Appliance and Documentum) or access Cloud Storage via the API to begin using the service. UKCloud has created a number of videos, help guides, manuals and FAQs to help train and instruct users so that they are up and running quickly and easily. These are available within the Knowledge Centre, accessed via the UKCloud Portal. UKCloud also has a large ecosystem of partners who can deliver additional services, such as support and professional services. UKCloud would be pleased to introduce you to the right partner to suit your needs. Service constraints UKCloud will adhere to the following in terms of maintenance windows: \"Planned Maintenance\" means any pre-planned disruptive maintenance to any of the infrastructure relating to the service. Planned Maintenance activity may result in periods of degradation or loss of availability depending on the nature of the activity required. In such cases, UKCloud shall provide affected customers with at least fourteen (14) days' notice of the Planned Maintenance. If during Planned Maintenance there is a loss of availability outside the scope described in the planned maintenance notification to the service, an SLA event will be triggered. \"Emergency Maintenance\" means any urgent maintenance required to prevent or mitigate against any event compromising the infrastructure relating to the service.

    "keywords": "How to view Cloud Storage information in the UKCloud Portal Overview Cloud Storage is UKCloud's object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Although you'll mostly interact with Cloud Storage through the API, the UKCloud Portal provides access to some information about your service. Within the UKCloud Portal you can: View information about the namespaces within your Cloud Storage environment View a list of users with access to a namespace Reset the secret key for a Cloud Storage user View information about the buckets within a namespace View a graphical representation of the storage consumed over the last 30 days Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have been granted access to the relevant namespace. Granting Portal permissions for Cloud Storage To view Cloud Storage information in the Portal, users must be granted access to the relevant namespace. Once access is granted, the user will be able to see the namespace, list the buckets in the namespace and reset the secret key. They will also be able to see consumption data for namespaces and buckets, with a graphical representation of average consumption for buckets. To grant Portal permissions for Cloud Storage: Log in to the UKCloud Portal and select your account. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal . In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Contacts option and select All Contacts . Find the contact for whom you want to grant permissions and click the Edit button. Click the Permissions tab. Scroll down to the Permissions for Cloud Storage section and select the Access check box for the relevant namespace. Viewing namespace and bucket information In ECS, objects are stored in buckets. In the UKCloud Portal, you can drill down through your namespaces to see the allocated buckets available in your Cloud Storage service. You can also view storage consumption over the last 30 days. Note It's not possible to view objects within the UKCloud Portal. In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Cloud Storage option and select ECS . The Storage tab lists the namespaces within the currently selected account. You can see: The number of buckets in the namespace The total amount of storage (in GiB) currently consumed by the objects in all the buckets in the namespace The service level of the namespace: STANDARD - data is stored in a single data centre ENHANCED - data is stored in a primary named data centre and copied to a second geographically remote data centre To list the buckets in a namespace, click the Buckets button for the namespace. On the Buckets tab, you can see the following information for each bucket in the selected namespace: The type of bucket: S3 or ATMOS The total amount of storage (in GiB) currently consumed by the objects in the bucket The number of objects in the bucket To view a graph that shows the amount of storage (in GiB) consumed by the objects in the bucket over the last 30 days, click the Show Consumption button for the bucket. Resetting your secret key Each user who can access Cloud Storage has an associated secret key to enable secure authentication. When attempting to access Cloud Storage, you must specify the appropriate secret key. If you forget the secret key for your user ID, you can reset it in the UKCloud Portal. Note For security purposes, the UKCloud Portal does not display secret keys, if you forget your secret key, you must reset it to generate a new one. In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Cloud Storage option and select ECS . Click the Users button for the namespace for which you want to reset the secret key. The Users tab lists the different user IDs associated with the namespace. Click the Reset Secret button next to the appropriate user ID. Click OK to confirm that you want to reset the secret key. Stay on the current page until a popup dialog box displays the new secret key. Make a note of the key and then click Close . Note After you close this dialog box, you will not be able to see the secret key again in the UKCloud Portal. If you do not make a note of the secret key or if you forget or lose it, you will need to reset it again. Next steps This guide has shown you how you can view information about your Cloud Storage service in the UKCloud Portal. For information about how to use the service, see the following articles in the Knowledge Centre: Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage Blueprint -- Using storage gateways with Cloud Storage Blueprint -- Using file browsers with Cloud Storage Feedback If you have any comments on this document or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

    "title": "Cloud Storage FAQs | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Cloud Storage FAQs Service What is the service? Cloud Storage from UKCloud is a secure next-generation storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases. It's based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS), which is an object storage technology natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility. Where will my data be physically stored? Data will be stored in one or both of our highly resilient tier 3, UK-sovereign data centres, which are separated by over 100km. How much data can I store? Our Cloud Storage solution can scale to multi-Petabytes across multiple sites, meeting the most demanding storage requirements. How many copies of my data are included? Object storage technology works in a slightly different way to traditional local storage solutions that tend to use RAID as a method to provide data durability. Instead, Cloud Storage provides data resilience using the Reed Solomon 12 + 4 erasure coding scheme, which splits an object into 12 data fragments and 4 coding fragments. These fragments are spread across multiple nodes in the data centre and the storage engine can reconstruct an object from any of the 12 data fragments, providing protection in the event of a disk or node failure. The ENHANCED service level stores an additional copy of your data in our second, geographically remote data centre. Management How do I access the platform? The service is Application Programming Interface (API) accessible, so is an ideal target for customer applications. It can also be used by existing systems. In addition, the platform can be accessed using a variety of software tools such as cloud storage gateways, file browsers and other software products. Documentation on ways to interact with the platform is available from the Knowledge Centre . Is data accessible via the PSN Assured connection also accessible via the internet? Cloud Storage in our Assured OFFICAL domain uses the same environment for both PSN Assured and internet connections. Although it is not possible to bridge between these connections, any objects placed in Cloud Storage via PSN Assured will also be accessible via the internet using the appropriate customer credentials. Which APIs are supported by the platform? Our Cloud Storage supports an Elastic Cloud Storage S3-compatible API and the native ATMOS RESTful API. Documentation and user manuals for supported API calls are available from the Knowledge Centre. How frequently can I back up data? The frequency of data backup is defined and managed by your organisation administrator. UKCloud's object storage is however highly durable and can automatically recover from disk and node failure, negating the need for a backup. What reports can I get about storage usage? We provide tools for monitoring used capacity and storage growth via the UKCloud Portal. What software tools are provided? UKCloud does not provide software tools for accessing the platform as storage is accessed via APIs, supporting S3 and Native ATMOS. You can however directly connect any S3 compatible tools to your storage (for example, S3 Browser and Cyberduck). How do I encrypt my data-at-rest? Data at rest encryption is an optional feature of our Cloud Storage product, with no additional cost. There are three options available to Cloud Storage customers looking to encrypt their data: Customer managed encryption. The Customer encrypts their data prior to moving it into UKCloud Cloud Storage. This avoids having to do any additional development against the ECS S3 API and ensures the customer retains the keys used to encrypt the data. Server-side encryption at rest with system generated keys. The customer enables server-side encryption in the request headers when creating buckets using the S3-compatible API, without specifying the keys. In this case the keys are auto-generated by ECS, simplifying key management. However, customers should be aware that the public and private keys used at the top of the hierarchy are shared between all customers encrypting their data through this method. See page 37 of the ECS Architecture whitepaper for more information on this encryption method. Server-side encryption at rest with user-supplied keys. The customer enables server-side encryption in the request header with user-supplied keys when creating buckets using the S3-compatible API. This increases complexity but ensures the customer retains control of their keys when using server-side encryption. There is an example of this method on page 14 of the ECS Security Configuration guide . Ultimately, it is down to the customer to select which encryption methodology should be used and understand the possible risks involved. How do I create new Cloud Storage users? To create additional users, you must raise a service request through the UKCloud Portal. When requesting additional users, you can specify whether they should have read-write or read-only access to your buckets. Support How do I raise a support ticket? UKCloud's secure online Portal provides the most common service management functionality, enabling you to raise support tickets through My Calls . Alternatively, you can contact support by phone or email. How do I manage my services? Cloud Storage on the Assured OFFICIAL domain can be managed over the internet (or other connectivity) via the UKCloud Portal. For the Elevated OFFICIAL domain, security requirements are stricter and require either a PSN-approved connection, UKCloud Secure Remote Access or CAPS-approved encryption. What are your service maintenance windows? As far as possible, planned maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on a Saturday or Sunday. We provide customers with at least 14 days' advance notice of planned maintenance. As far as possible, emergency maintenance of UKCloud's infrastructure takes place between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00 (UK local time) Monday to Sunday, or between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00 (UK local time) on Saturday or Sunday, unless there is an identified and demonstrable immediate risk to a customer's environment. Whenever possible, we provide customers with at least six hours advance notice of emergency maintenance. Does the Cloud Storage solution support browser-based form POST upload? Cloud Storage fully supports standard REST API commands (Post, Put, Get, Delete, and Head). Cloud Storage's RESTful APIs support the use of HTML forms to create and update objects. Is Cloud Storage object synchronisation (for example, protection offered at each VM type) synchronous or asynchronous? Protection is asynchronous - a single copy is created, and subsequent copies of the data are created when bandwidth allows. During busy periods, this protection can take longer to complete. Onboarding How can I get started with the service? Within five days of accepting your order, we'll create your primary administrator account and send you a welcome pack, which includes the URL for the UKCloud Portal and associated authentication details. Once you've signed up to the service, you can access your unique credentials (User ID, Subtenant ID, resolvable hostname and shared secret) through the UKCloud Portal, which you simply enter into an EMC Cloud Tiering Appliance or other compatible automated solution. Why can't I see my secret key in the UKCloud Portal? For security reasons, the UKCloud Portal only displays a secret key for a short amount of time after it is set. After this time, the secret key is replaced with the text [FILTERED]. If you forget your secret key, or if it is compromised, you can reset it by clicking the Reset secret button in the Storage section of the Portal. When you reset your secret key, you'll be able to see it in the Portal for up to 24 hours before it is hidden. Billing and legal What is the smallest unit of time I will be billed for? Storage is billed on a per-GiB per-month basis, and is based on utilisation of the storage platform across the month. The minimum amount of time is one month. How is my storage bill calculated? Used storage is calculated on a daily basis. The data for a month is collected, and the average consumption calculated and rounded up to the next whole number to provide the number of GiB consumed in a month. How can I view billing information? Billing information is provided in an evidence file on the first working day of the month for your previous months spend. How do I pay for the service and what are the termination fees? Billing for the service is one month in arrears and payment can be made by direct bank transfer. There are no termination fees for the service. You are responsible for extracting your own data from the platform if required. UKCloud may make an additional charge for transferring data out of the service. Is there a free trial? Yes, we offer a 30-day free trial so that you can test and evaluate our service without commitment. Your trial provides you with a live environment on the UKCloud platform to test our services and verify whether they are suited to your needs. Security What data is suitable for our cloud? The service is hosted in the UK and operated by security-cleared staff. It has extensive independent validation (including NCSC design reviews) that is fully aligned with the 14 NCSC Cloud Security Principles, and is therefore ideal for all data classified at Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL (including OFFICIAL SENSITIVE). Can systems on different UKCloud platforms communicate with one another? UKCloud's Cross Domain Security Zone allows customers to use the UKCloud-defined and managed UKCloud Guard or a customer-designed and managed Walled Garden to enable communication between platforms. For more information, see the Cross Domain Security Zone Service Definition on the Digital Marketplace. Is there a protective monitoring service? Yes, protective monitoring is included for our IaaS platform and follows GPG 13, more information can be found in our Protective Monitoring FAQs. ."

    "keywords": "How to create a Service Principal Name for Azure Stack - PowerShell This document explains how to create a Service Principal Name to manage Azure and Azure Stack using PowerShell. It will guide you through the creation of: an Azure application a Service Principal Name role assignment permissions What is a Service Principal Name? An Azure Service Principal Name (SPN) is a security identity used by user-created applications, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources. Think of it as a 'user identity' (username and password or certificate) with a specific role, and tightly controlled permissions. It only needs to be able to do specific things, unlike a general user identity. It improves security if you grant it only the minimum permissions level needed to perform its management tasks. To log in and manage your resources via SPN you'll need to create an Azure application and then assign SPN to it. Only then will you be able to perform tasks against your environment. Prerequisites Prerequisites from a Windows-based external client are: PowerShell 5.1, AzureStack and Azure AD PowerShell Modules Configure PowerShell Environment and Azure Stack Modules Azure AD PowerShell Module Install-Module AzureAD -Force -Verbose Active Azure Subscription (required to create SPN if you want to use the same SPN for both Azure and Azure Stack) Overview of the creation process for Azure and Azure Stack SPN Declare your variables accordingly.

    "title": "Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden Overview The UKCloud Walled Garden provides self-service access to the Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) so that you can design, implement and manage your own cross‑domain solution, using technology and application services of your choice. UKCloud provides an assurance wrap by managing firewalls between the security domains and ensuring you use appropriate risk management to understand and mitigate identified risks. The Walled Garden is ideal if you require more control and flexibility over what is passed between security domains, to support a wider range of use cases. This guide covers the steps you need to follow to get your Walled Garden up and running. Intended audience This guide is intended for customers who have: Completed the CDSZ Walled Garden assurance wrap Been approved to have a Base Implementation of the Walled Garden to allow data to pass between the Assured and Elevated security domains on the UKCloud platform Before you begin Before you can start to implement a walled garden, you must have completed and passed the appropriate application process. For more information, see the UKCloud Cross Domain Security Zone application process . After your Walled Garden application has been approved, a service request is raised to implement the Walled Garden virtual data centre (VDC) and, if necessary, Elevated and Assured VDCs. Note If a service request for this implementation already exists, the existing request is used and a new one is not raised. You can track the progress of the service request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. During the provisioning of the Walled Garden service, we'll ask you for some additional information via the service request: The customer account in which you would like the Walled Garden VDC to be provisioned, if different from the customer completing the Walled Garden application. Whether you plan to have a single or dual site solution. How many VDCs you need to be set up in each security domain. If you're connecting new or existing VDCs to the Walled Garden VDC. If you're connecting to existing VDCs, we'll need to know information such as NFT details, customer account, and so on. The external source IP addresses from which you'd like to access the Assured VDC (up to a maximum of 50). These IP addresses are the locations from which you can build and test the environment (for example, offices or end user premises). The build phase of the Walled Garden environment can take up to 10 working days depending on the complexity of the deployment. When the environment has been fully provisioned, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will send you the information you need to access it. Building your Walled Garden service As soon as you have access to your environment, you can start to build your Walled Garden services. You then have 42 calendar days to: Complete the provisioning of the virtual machines (VMs) and networking Complete an IT Health Check Present your evidence pack to the customer and UKCloud SIROs It is important to remember that while the UKCloud Portal for the Assured security domain is accessible from the internet, the Portal for the Elevated security domain and Walled Garden services is accessible only through the PSN Protected network or through UKCloud's Secure Remote Access (SRA) service. Setting up your networking First, you need to replicate the networking that you set out in your Walled Garden application diagrams. This involves the creation of external and internal networking, as well as the creation of rules on the virtual firewall within your environment. For information about creating networks and firewall rules, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware and How to build a virtual machine with UKCloud for VMware . You also need to create the rules that allow connectivity between the different VDCs through the Walled Garden. This involves the creation of firewall rules, static routes and/or NAT rules. Networking examples There are two options for networking between the VDCs in the Walled Garden service: Option 1: Create static routes between the VDCs; this is the simplest option for connecting VDCs Option 2: Use NAT rules on top of the static routes; this option may be appropriate if you want to abstract the static routes The diagrams below provide examples for both options. Note For both options: You cannot route public IP addresses to the vCNS Edges in the Walled Garden The Org VDC networks 192.168.XXX.XX in the examples below are illustrative and you should replace these with your own details You must have one VM in the Walled Garden VDC connecting to both vCNS Edges Each of the examples below assumes that the appropriate firewall rules are in place You must apply an SNAT rule in the Elevated security domain to enable connectivity to UKCloud services Building your virtual machines The next step is to build the VMs that you outlined in the Walled Garden application. This involves deploying the VMs from either the vCloud Director catalog or from template VMs as OVF files. The VMs must be able to access UKCloud services, such as OS repositories, the network time server, the Key Management Server (KMS), and so on. You may also need to access external services, such as antivirus repositories. You must configure this access in your VDC networking. For more information about creating VMs and accessing UKCloud services, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . Testing your environment When you've built your VMs and networking, you can start to test the environment. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VMs should be able to talk to each other across the Walled Garden. If you have any issues, check your network rules. Performing the IT Health Check As part of the Base Implementation, you're required to conduct an IT Health Check (ITHC) of the environment. The ITHC must be conducted by an independent CHECK Service Provider, approved and classified as Green Light by the National Cyber Security Centre (NSCS). You can search for appropriate providers on the NSCS web site . Before beginning the ITHC, notify UKCloud by raising a service request in My Calls and completing the External Security Review Test (ESRT) application form . Ideally, we require five working days' notice before the work is due to be carried out. The ITHC scope should be relevant to the environment. For example, if you're using the Walled Garden to pull application and antivirus updates from the internet, then security controls relevant to facilitate this should be in scope. Bear in mind that the end customer accreditor may dictate the scope of the ITHC. Presenting your results When you've conducted your ITHC, with no results higher than Medium, present your evidence pack to the UKCloud SIRO. The evidence pack comprises the Walled Garden assurance wrap form and the following, as detailed in sections (a) to (c) in section 3.7 of the Walled Garden assurance wrap form: (a) Evidence of protective monitoring aligning with the 12 Protective Monitoring Controls (PMCs) in Good Practice Guide 13 (GPG13). The protective monitoring will need to span both sides of the Walled Garden as well as the Walled Garden itself. You can provide this by explaining how each of the PMCs is met by the protective monitoring solution in place. (b) The ITHC results, with no risks higher than a Medium. If you do have results higher than a Medium but you have put a remediation plan in place that has been accepted by the end customer accreditor, then we may accept this depending on the issues raised. (c) An approval statement confirming that the end customer accreditor is satisfied with the overall security regime and is happy for the solution to be live. If the information provided in the Walled Garden evidence pack is acceptable, the UKCloud SIRO signs off the Live Implementation and any restrictions that have been imposed on the environment by UKCloud Customer Service are lifted.

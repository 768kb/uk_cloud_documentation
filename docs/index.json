    "keywords": "VM compatibility with UKCloud for Oracle Software Introduction This article outlines what you need to do to make sure your Oracle VMs (OVMs) are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software service. You may find this useful if you're moving VMs from UKCloud for VMware to UKCloud for Oracle Software. OVF and VMDK OVF and VMDK files are not compatible with Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM), the management plane that's used to deploy and manage your UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. To make sure your VMs are compatible with UKCloud for Oracle Software you may need to transform your VMs. OVA files (Assembly option) and tar.gz/tgz (Template option) are the only accepted file formats. OVA If you select the Assembly option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an OVA Assembly package file (ova file). Your .ova file should contain the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .ovf --- the OVF descriptor file, which contains all VM specs metadata and links to the embedded virtual disk image file (with a .vmdk extension) MyVM .mf --- contains metadata that is used for integrity and authenticity checks; this data must be correct for the .ova file to be accepted in most cases MyVM .vmdk --- the embedded virtual disk image file As the exported .ova file also contains file hashes that are unique to the files included in the package, simply creating a tar file with these contents will not work in most cases. For most virtualisation platforms, it's best to use the export functionality from the source virtualisation platform to generate the .ova file. One way of converting your VMs to an .ova file would be to use the OVF Tool, for example: ovftool \"original.ovf\" \"original.ova\" Tip! Make sure you include the quotation marks (\"). You can download the OVF Tool from: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?downloadGroup=OVFTOOL400&productId=353 TAR If you select the Template option on the upload page, then the uploader will expect an Oracle VM Template file (either a .tgz or .tar.gz file). This gzipped tarball file normally contains the following files (in the exact order listed): MyVM .cfg --- contains the VM specs metadata and links to the embedded RAW disk image file, normally named system.img system.img --- the embedded RAW disk image file, either exported from another XEN platform or converted from other virtual disk formats Upload size For any uploads larger than 500 MB, you'll need to allow sufficient time for the upload to complete before clicking the Upload button or it will fail and the item will not appear in your software library. There is currently no upload progress indicator on OEM. Oracle is aware of this but are treating it as an enhancement request therefore there's currently no indication of when the upload progress indicator will be added on future releases of the platform software.

    "title": "Oracle licensing on the UKCloud platform | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Oracle licensing on the UKCloud platform Overview Due to the licensing rules regarding Oracle, it is not possible to install and run Oracle software on the UKCloud public cloud platform. However, there are currently two ways for customers to install and run Oracle software with UKCloud: Private Cloud for Compute . This is a dedicated hardware solution that limits the number of cores, RAM and storage that would require Oracle licensing. Note that this may not be financially efficient for all customers, and this will be a bare metal environment that has not been prepared for Oracle. UKCloud for Oracle Software . This is a solution specifically designed to host Oracle solutions on a separate platform. This enables Oracle licensing to be used correctly, and is also financially efficient. The remainder of this article is regarding general Oracle licensing. Important Licensing rules from vendors such as Oracle can change frequently and so customers should validate their specific requirement with Oracle at the time of ordering. This information is correct as of June 2015. For customers wishing to licence Oracle software on virtual machines within the UKCloud platform, there are some important issues to consider with regards to the four licencing options available which are described below. Named User By implementing this licencing option, the customer can run as many Oracle servers as they want for a fixed fee ‘per named user’. As this license model is independent of the size or number of servers, it is preferable for use in multi-tenant cloud environments such as the UKCloud platform. UKCloud appreciate that this solution may not be valid for customers that already have ‘per processor” licencing. Per Processor This type of license allows the customer to have as many users as they need for a fixed cost ‘per processor’ that the servers run on. In a traditional physical or virtualised estate, it is possible to isolate a small subset of the overall physical servers to specifically run Oracle. In this way, only those specific servers need to be licensed for Oracle. In most multi-tenant cloud environments such as the UKCloud platform, the per processor virtual machines can run on any physical server and so, practically, Oracle requires all of those servers to be licensed – which is simply not cost effective. Oracle software within a cloud based environment can also be licensed via the per-processor option if the cloud environment is running Oracle Virtual Machine (OVM) as the hypervisor. However, due to the design of the cloud environment, this is not something UKCloud can provide or support. Oracle has negotiated an agreement with a few public cloud providers (at the time of writing, only Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure) to allow customers to license only specific host servers, but this is not yet a widely available licencing agreement. Dedicated Compute platform Customers can take advantage of the 'per processor' licencing model, by using the UKCloud Dedicated Compute platform which will provide the customer with a set hardware configuration. The Dedicated Compute option enables a customer to specify a dedicated hardware cluster of a certain number of physical servers, and this option can help customers who need more certainty as to the configuration and capacity of the cluster which underpins part of their application, whilst being also able to accommodate the compromises of having a dedicated cluster with regards to reduced levels of agility and flexibility. Application Specific Full Use Licensing An Application Specific Full Use (ASFU) license is a restricted type of license sold by a Solution Provider in conjunction with its third-party Application Package. For example, you can buy an ASFU license from SAP AG to use Oracle with the SAP/R3 system. This license would then be application specific and cannot be used for anything else. Embedded Software License An Embedded Software License (ESL) is a very restrictive license type available from Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) who embed Oracle technology into their product. An end-user may not even be aware that the software package contains Oracle technology and should not be able to access it directly as a developer or system administrator. An example of this licensing model in use may be a Point of Sale system that requires a database to log transactions. Note The ASFU and ESL licencing options are outside the scope of UKCloud control.

This Getting Started Guide provides an overview of the functionality available with UKCloud for Oracle Software. Intended audience This guide is intended for customers who want to get up and running with UKCloud for Oracle Software. Introduction to UKCloud for Oracle Software Many applications running in the UK public sector today have a backbone powered by Oracle software. They include ERP solutions, finance systems (such as payroll), HR systems and wide variety of citizen‑supporting applications. Oracle solutions have traditionally been subject to licensing and technical requirements that have made it challenging to carry out cloud transition projects and meet the government's Cloud First policy. UKCloud for Oracle Software enables you to start your cloud journey with your Oracle applications. It overcomes the licensing and technical barriers, and provides the trusted, connected and flexible Assured OFFICIAL and non-internet-connected Elevated OFFICIAL cloud platforms you need to deliver your critical Oracle applications in the cloud. UKCloud for Oracle Software can help you achieve the business goals at the centre of your strategy, without risking your operational ability to execute. The service has been designed and tested for compatibility with the most popular Oracle applications used in citizen‑facing solutions today, including: Oracle database (including features such as encryption and Data Guard) Oracle WebLogic Server Oracle Fusion Applications Oracle Enterprise Manager Oracle E-Business Suite UKCloud for Oracle Software provides workloads with an uncontended infrastructure optimised for the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. You can right‑size the allocated resources to suit the changing demands of your application; ensuring performance and avoiding over‑capacity. You can specify the resource allocation of each workload independently: simply choose the appropriate CPU cores, amount of memory and required storage from the catalogue. The service offers the following technical benefits specific to Oracle workloads: Use of core-pinning technology means that Oracle workloads operating on the UKCloud platform aren't subject to the types of movement that can unbalance Oracle applications running on other cloud platforms The scalable nature of our service enables you to add or remove cores in line with your understanding of the performance requirements of your solution Self-service management of your environment via our Customer Portal, which you can also use to programmatically control your Oracle environment Virtual firewalls to manage connectivity into and out of your environment -- self-service and free of charge IPsec and SSL VPN/SDN to create secure connections between users and other environments using a variety of included tunnelling technologies Basic load balancing to configure active/active solutions that are resilient to outages and can handle high levels of activity, using our on‑platform, out‑of‑the‑box load balancers Persistent storage so that your data remains, even when a virtual machine (VM) is turned off, ensuring that your application data remains consistent and available Oracle licensing compliance UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include Oracle licensing but, because the platform is powered by OVM technology, you can be assured that it is compliant with Oracle's licensing requirements and you can bring your own Oracle licensing to build your solutions. UKCloud ensures that hard partitioning is in place in all customer guest VMs in order to conform to Oracle licensing policies. When you create or modify a VM, automatic CPU pinning ensures that the VM won't use any CPUs other than the ones specifically pinned to the VM's vCPUs. If you have any questions about Oracle licensing, contact your Cloud Architect, Customer Success Manager or Technical Account Manager. If you require assistance building out your Oracle solution, we can put you in contact with one or our partners who specialises in Oracle technologies. Your UKCloud for Oracle Software estate The management of your Oracle estate is split between Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) and vCloud Director: Use OEM to build and manage your VMs and templates Use vCloud Director to create your VM networks and configure your edge gateway, including firewall rules and VPN connections When you first purchase UKCloud for Oracle Software, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) creates an Oracle tenant to act as a top‑level container for your Oracle VMs. As your estate grows, you can add more tenants to logically organise your resources. Within your Oracle tenant you can create the VMs that comprise your Oracle applications. Before you begin You should have received your OEM login credentials, including the URL for OEM Cloud Control.

Building virtual machines Your Oracle applications will consist of one or more VMs. In the Cloud Console, you create a VM by requesting a server. You can base your VMs on assemblies or templates. On the Infrastructure -- Oracle VM Cloud Services page you can view and manage all your Oracle VMs. More information! How to build an Oracle virtual machine Setting up your network Before you can start using the VMs in your Oracle environment, you need to create the network that connects the VMs to each other, and potentially also to the outside world. This network enables your VMs to communicate with each other or access external networks. A single Oracle tenant can have multiple networks. When UKCloud sets up a new Oracle tenant for you, we'll usually create an edge gateway for that tenant, but the creation of any networks is your responsibility. Networking and connectivity for UKCloud for Oracle Software is managed within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Note Because you create your network in vCloud Director, you'll see references to VMware terminology, such as organisations and virtual data centres (VDCs). In UKCloud for Oracle Software, an Oracle tenant is equivalent to a VDC. There are two types of network: An isolated (internally connected) network provides access only to the VMs within the Oracle tenant (see How to create an isolated VDC network ). A routed (externally connected) network provides access to machines and networks outside the Oracle tenant via the edge gateway. You can have up to nine usable routed networks per tenant: one for each connectivity type (see How to create a routed VDC network ). Configuring your edge gateway An edge gateway controls how traffic from the outside world comes into and out of your environment. It is very important to make sure that your edge gateway is configured correctly to make your applications available but also secure. The tools for configuring your edge gateway are provided within vCloud Director, which you access through the UKCloud Portal rather than Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Your edge gateway provides the following services: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) --- The edge gateway can act as a DHCP server for VMs connected to VDC networks connected to an edge (see How to create a DHCP pool ). Network address translation (NAT) --- NAT rules determine where to direct inbound and outbound traffic (see How to create NAT rules ). Firewall --- The firewall controls which networks and ports can communicate through the edge gateway (see How to create firewall rules ). Static routing --- Provides static routes from the edge gateway to other networks, for example, networks in other VDCs in your compute service (see How to create a static route ). VPN --- IPsec site-to-site VPN is available on the edge gateway (see How to configure IPsec VPN ). Load balancing --- The edge gateway provides simple HTTP and HTTPS load balancing using round robin (see How to configure a load balancer ). Logging out of the Cloud Control console When you're done working in the Cloud Control console, we recommend that you log out to prevent unauthorised access. To log out of the Cloud Control console, click your user name and select Log Out . Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned the basics about UKCloud for Oracle Software.

    "title": "Connect to Azure Stack with CLI environment for UKCloud | based on Microsoft Docs | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "Install and configure CLI for use with Azure Stack In this article, we will guide you through the process of installing and using the Azure command-line interface (CLI) to manage Azure Stack. Azure CLI can be used to manage resources such as create virtual machines, deploy Azure Resource Manager templates, etc. Install CLI Sign in to your development workstation and install CLI. Azure Stack requires the 2.0 version of Azure CLI. You can install that by using the steps described in the Install Azure CLI 2.0 article. To verify if the installation was successful, open a terminal or a command prompt window and run the following command: az --version You should see the version of Azure CLI and other dependent libraries that are installed on your computer. Connect to Azure Stack Use the following steps to connect to Azure Stack: Register your Azure Stack environment by running the az cloud register command. To register the user environment, use: az cloud register \\ -n AzureStackUser \\ --endpoint-resource-manager \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" \\ --suffix-storage-endpoint \"frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" \\ --suffix-keyvault-dns \".vault.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" \\ --endpoint-active-directory-graph-resource-id \"https://graph.windows.net/\" \\ To register the user environment - One Liner: az cloud register -n AzureStackUser --endpoint-resource-manager \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --suffix-storage-endpoint \"frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --suffix-keyvault-dns \".vault.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" --endpoint-active-directory-graph-resource-id \"https://graph.windows.net/\" --endpoint-vm-image-alias-doc <URI of the document which contains virtual machine image aliases> Set the active environment by using the following commands. For the user environment, use: az cloud set -n AzureStackUser Update your environment configuration to use the Azure Stack specific API version profile. To update the configuration, run the following command: az cloud update --profile 2017-03-09-profile Sign in to your Azure Stack environment by using the az login command. You can sign in to the Azure Stack environment either as a user or as a service principal . Sign in as a user : You can either specify the username and password directly within the az login command or authenticate by using a browser. You have to do the latter if your account has multi-factor authentication enabled. Example of username : Active directory global administrator or user account i.e. username@ .onmicrosoft.com or username@domain.com az login -u username@<aadtenant>.onmicrosoft.com -p <password> Note If your user account has multi-factor authentication enabled, you can use the az login command without providing the -u parameter. Running the command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate. Sign in as a service principal : Before you sign in, create a service principal through the Azure portal or CLI and assign it a role. Now, sign in by using the following command: az login \\ --tenant <Azure Active Directory Tenant name. For example: myazurestack.onmicrosoft.com> \\ --service-principal \\ -u <Application Id of the Service Principal> \\ -p <Key generated for the Service Principal> Verify that your environment is set correctly to and that AzureStackUser is the active cloud. az cloud list --output table To list command subgroups run: az --help To list commands for specific subgroup run: az <subgroupname> --help Test the connectivity Now that we've got everything setup, let's use CLI to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an application and add a virtual machine. Use the following command to create a resource group named \"MyResourceGroup\": az group create -n MyResourceGroup -l frn00006 If the resource group is created successfully, the previous command outputs the following properties of the newly created resource: Get the virtual machine URNs Because of the known issue with Image Aliases we have not published the alias.json file yet. Instead please use the following command to obtain releveant image URNs for your VM deployment. az vm image list --all --output table You are retrieving all the images from server which could take more than a minute.

Note Azure Stack does not support Managed Disks hence we add --use-unmanaged-disk parameter. Also, you need to create your Resource Group first. admin-username and admin-password are given as examples above - these are the credentials which must be used to login to the VM once it is created. Known issues There are some known issues that you must be aware of when using CLI in Azure Stack: The CLI interactive mode i.e the az interactive command is not yet supported in Azure Stack. To get the list of virtual machine images available in Azure Stack, use the az vm images list --all command instead of the az vm image list command. Specifying the --all option makes sure that response returns only the images that are available in your Azure Stack environment. Virtual machine image aliases that are available in Azure may not be applicable to Azure Stack. When using virtual machine images, you must use the entire URN parameter (Canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.3-LTS:1.0.0) instead of the image alias. This URN must match the image specifications as derived from the az vm images list command. By default, CLI 2.0 uses “Standard_DS1_v2” as the default virtual machine image size. However, this size is not yet available in Azure Stack, so, you need to specify the --size parameter explicitly when creating a virtual machine. You can get the list of virtual machine sizes that are available in Azure Stack by using the az vm list-sizes --location frn00006 command.

    "title": "How to install and configure OpenVPN | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to install and configure OpenVPN Overview Secure remote access to the cloud is essential to cloud adoption and use. UKCloud for VMware comes with a dedicated edge gateway, providing a simple and easy-to-use solution that supports IPsec site-to-site virtual private networks (VPNs) and a limited number of remote access client VPNs designed for occasional use. If you require a more flexible or scalable solution, you can deploy your own choice of virtual appliances (either open-source solutions, such as OpenVPN or commercial solutions from a supplier, such as Cisco, F5 or Palo Alto), instead of using the limited VPN service provided with the default edge gateway. This article details the steps required to obtain, deploy and configure an OpenVPN virtual appliance to obtain remote access to your virtual data centres (VDCs) running on the UKCloud platform. Note OpenVPN is a licensed product. Without a licence key, you are limited to only two concurrent VPN connections. If you require additional concurrent connections, you’ll need to obtain and install a licence key. Preparing your virtual data centre To secure your environment, we recommend that you deploy the OpenVPN appliance into a new, routed VDC network. Ideally, no other virtual machines (VMs) should connect to this network. This enables you to tightly control access from VPN clients to the VMs in your environment using firewall rules on the edge gateway. However, if you're approaching the network interface limit of your edge gateway, it's possible to deploy the OpenVPN appliance into an existing network. Create a new VDC network To create a new VDC network: In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Right-click your VDC and select Open , then select the Org VDC Networks tab. Click the green plus icon. On the Select Network Type page of the New Organization VDC Network dialog box, select Create a routed network . Provide the network addressing information requested in the rest of the dialog box and then click Finish . More information! Creating routed Org VDC networks Configuring the edge gateway After you've created the network, you'll need to configure the edge gateway to control access to the VMs in your environment. To configure the edge gateway: In vCloud Director, select the Administration tab. Right-click your VDC and select Open , then select the Edge Gateways tab Right-click your gateway and select Edge Gateway Services . To control access to your VMs, you should create the following: A source NAT rule to allow the OpenVPN appliance outbound access to the internet. A destination NAT rule to allow inbound access from the internet to the OpenVPN appliance. A firewall rule to allow inbound access from the internet on port 443 . One or more firewall rules to allow users connected to the OpenVPN appliance to access VMs on other networks for administration purposes. Note All VPN users will be NATed to the IP address of the OpenVPN appliance. One or more firewall rules to allow access from trusted environments to the OpenVPN appliance on the admin port (port 943 by default, but can be changed) More information! vCNS Edge Services: NAT and vCNS Edge Services: Firewall Obtaining the latest OpenVPN appliance To ensure you're running the latest release of OpenVPN, we recommend that you download the latest version of the appliance directly from the OpenVPN website: Go to the following location to download the latest OVA file: https://swupdate.openvpn.org/appliances/AS2.ova In vCloud Director, select the Catalogs tab. In the left navigation panel, select My Organization's Catalogs Open the catalog you'd like to add the appliance to, or create a new catalog. Click the Upload button and upload the OVA file to the catalog. Deploying the OpenVPN appliance To deploy the OpenVPN appliance: In vCloud Director, select the My Cloud tab. In the left navigation panel, select vApps . In the toolbar, click the Add vApp from OVF icon. In the Add vApp from OVF wizard, on the Select Source page, select Local file and browse to the OVA file that you downloaded, then click Next . The appliance will be deployed as a single VM inside the vApp. On the Review Details page, confirm the details of the OVA file and then click Next On the Select Name and Location page, enter a meaningful Name and Description for your vApp From the Virtual Datacenter list, select the VDC in which you want to create the vApp and then click Next . On the Configure Resources page, select your desired storage policy and then click Next . ON the Configure Networking page, provide a name for the VM. Select the Switch to the advanced networking workflow check box. This enables you to select your desired network and change the IP assignment method. Typically, we recommend that you deploy the VPN appliance to its own network segment (as described in Preparing your virtual data centre , and use the Static IP Pool method of IP assignment. Continue through the wizard and click Finish . There are no further changes necessary unless you want to customise the vApp further to suit your environment. When the vApp has deployed and is powered on, you'll need to reset (reboot) the VM before logging in for the first time to force the networking changes made during VMWare's guest customisations to take effect before you start configuring OpenVPN. Performing initial configuration To perform initial configuration: In vCloud Director, right-click your OpenVPN VM and select Popout Console . Log in to the VM as the root user. Tip To obtain the root password, right-click the VM, select Properties , click the Guest OS Customization tab and make a note of the password. You'll be prompted to answer a series of questions: Licence agreement: --- Enter yes to accept. Will this be the primary Access Server node? --- Enter yes . Please specify the network interface and IP address to be used by the Admin Web UI -- If the guest customisations were applied correctly, this should default to eth0 , which should be configured with an IP address on the network you selected during deployment. Please specify the port number for the Admin Web UI --- Enter your desired port number, or accept the default of 943 . A separate port is not strictly needed for administration but is recommended. Please specify the TCP port number for the OpenVPN Daemon --- We recommend that you use the default of 443 where possible as the use of a non-standard port may cause problems when connecting from corporate networks. Should client traffic be routed by default through VPN? --- Entering yes will prevent your client device from accessing any other networks (for example, your corporate network) while the VPN is connected. For ease of use, we suggest you answer no to this question. Should client DNS traffic be routed by default through the VPN? --- If you answered yes to the previous question, all traffic will be routed through the VPN anyway, so your answer here will not matter. If you answered no to the previous question, you'll probably want to answer no to this question so that your DNS queries are answered by the usual servers. Use local authentication via internal DB? --- Enter yes unless you want to authenticate users from an existing directory service (Active Directory/LDAP). Should private subnets be accessible to clients by default? --- Answer yes to enable access to your cloud networks via the VPN. Do you wish to login to the Admin UI as \"openvpn\"? --- Answer yes to create a local user account named openvpn . If you answer no , you'll need to set up a different user name and password. Please specify your OpenVPN-AS license key --- If you've purchased a licence, enter the licence key, otherwise leave this blank. When you've completed the setup wizard, you'll need to create user accounts and passwords on the local operating system (unless you configured an LDAP directory). If you opted to use the default openvpn account, you'll need to configure its password: #passwd openvpn Press ^D to log off the console, but before you do so, there are some additional system configurations, detailed in the following sections, that you might want to perform shile you're connected to the console. Check the DNS resolver configuration is in place During our tests, the DNS resolver configuration was not added by the VMware customisations. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/network/interfaces Use the arrow keys to scroll down. Below the line specifying the default gateway, add the following: dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 Press ^O to save the file, then ^X to exit the text editor. Restart the networking service for the change to take effect: # service networking restart Configure the keyboard The default configuration is for a US keyboard. To reconfigure for UK: Enter the following command: # dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration Step through the wizard. There's no need to restart anything when you're finished. Apply updates It's a good idea to apply the latest upgrades to the system. Enter the following command: # apt-get update && apt-get upgrade You'll be prompted to approve the installation of any updates. Install NTP Installing NTP is good practice anyway, but is required if you intend to use two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator. Enter the following command: # apt-get install ntp When the installation is complete, update the configuration file to point to UKCloud's NTP servers. # pico /etc/ntp.config Use the arrow keys to scroll down until you reach the lines beginning with server . Change the first two lines to reflect the UKCloud servers, and comment out the remaining two lines: Server 37.26.90.192 Server 37.26.94.232 Configuring administration options To configure administration options: Log on to the admin interface at: https:// ip_address /admin To set the hostname, under Configuration , select Server Network Settings and then set the Hostname or IP Address to either a public IP address or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that your client will be able to resolve. Save the settings on this page. Under Configuration , select VPN settings and, in the Routing section, add any additional subnets that your VPN users should have access to. These will usually be the IP subnets configured on all of your VDC networks. This is the minimum configuration required to be able to establish a VPN connection. If you want to create new user accounts, under User Management , select User Permissions . You can configure the password for each account by clicking the Show link in the More Settings column. Note Be sure to use complex passwords. Logging in and connecting You can download the VPN client software and connection profiles directly from the appliance by browsing to the following location and logging in with a valid user name and password: https:// ip_address / The downloaded client software and profile includes the client certificate that is required for authentication. When you've installed the client software or profile, you can initiate connections directly from the client. Securing the appliance We strongly recommend that you further secure the appliance by making the changes suggested in the following sections. Change all default passwords If you've not already done so, change the root password to something more secure. Log in to the OpenVPN VM console as the root user. Enter the following command: # passwd Lock down unused ports with iptables The OpenVPN configuration utility adds the required ALLOW entries to iptables automatically. To deny all other traffic, enter the following command: # iptables -A INPUT -j DROP Enable two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator You can enable two-factor authentication via the OpenVPN administration interface. Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https:// ip_address /admin Under Configuration , select Client Settings then click the checkbox to enable Google Authenticator support. Note Users will need to enter or scan the Google Authenticator secret by logging into the client portal ( http:// ip_address / ). When they've configured the secret, they should click the I scanned the QR code button to enforce two-factor authentication. Lock down the Admin Web UI and Client Web UI By default, both Admin and Client UIs are accessible over port 443 . This can pose a security risk if you've opened port 443 to the internet to allow users to connect from anywhere. Besides the obvious risk of unauthorised access to the administration interface, should an attacker gain access to the client interface, they'll be able to download the client certificates necessary to establish a VPN connection. You can limit the administration and client interfaces so that they are accessible only via the administration port number ( 943 by default). This enables you to restrict access to this port to a trusted IP address or network, while allowing VPN access on port 443 from anywhere. Your users will need to log in initially from the trusted network to install the client software, client certificate and configure Google Authenticator, before being able to establish VPN access. To lock down the administration and client interfaces: Log on to the administration interface with the default account at: https:// ip_address /admin Under Configuration , select Server Network Settings . Under Service Forwarding in the VPN Server section, clear the check boxes for Admin Web Server and Client Web Server . Disable root SSH login If connecting via SSH, it's best practice to connect with a non-privileged account, then sudo to root if needed. This prevents an attacker from brute-forcing the root password. Enter the following command: # pico /etc/ssh/sshd\\_config Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file, and change the PermitRootLogin to no . Disable the default account During the initial setup, you created an user name and password to log in to the administration interface. This account, with the name openvpn , is configured to be always active, disregarding its status in the User Permissions area. In addition, if you configured two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator, this is not enforced for the default account. To disable the default account: Enter the following command: # pico /usr/local/openvpn_as/etc/as.conf Use the arrow keys to scroll down the file until you see entries starting with boot_pam_users . Comment out the entry for the user name you chose for the default account. Usually this is the boot_pam_users.0= entry. Restart the OpenVPN service for the change to take effect: # service restart openvpnas More help If you have any issues regarding the updating or support of Microsoft Server, contact the UKCloud support team by raising a Service Request.

You should create your Cloud GPU VM using the appropriate UKCloud template from the GPGPU public catalogue. Your deployed Cloud GPU VM should be using hardware version 11. The shell VM in the Cloud GPU VM template uses hardware version 11. Snapshot Protection is not available for your VM, so you must implement your own backup solution. Currently, there is no high availability or disaster recovery option; your VM cannot be migrated to a different host in the event of host failure. In the event of a host failure, you must wait for the host to be returned to service. Creating your virtual machine Before you request your Cloud GPU service, you must create a VM for the service using the UKCloud GPU-enabled template. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . If necessary, switch to the appropriate account. Click My VMs . Click the compute service (vOrg) that contains the VDC in which you want to create the VM. Important You must create your VM in a PRIORITY VDC. If you don't already have a VDC for this type of workload, you can create one using the steps in How to build your Enterprise Compute Cloud estate using the UKCloud Portal . On the vCloud Director tab, enter your password and click Confirm . On the vCloud Director Home tab, click Add vApp from Catalog . On the Select vApp Template page of the Add vApp from Catalog dialog box, from the Look in list, select Public Catalogs . Select All Templates . In the search field, enter GPGPU and click the Refresh icon. Select the GPGPU template and click Next . Note The GPGPU template provides a shell VM with no disks attached, hence no operating system installed. You'll need add the necessary disks so that you can install your preferred operating system on the VM. On the Select Name and Location page, give the vApp a Name and Description . From the Virtual Datacenter list, select the VDC in which you want to create the VM and click Next . Note You must create your VM in a PRIORITY VDC.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Email and Collaboration as a Service Overview UKCloud offers an Email and Collaboration service, powered by Zimbra, to enable you to have a cloud hosted, secure email service, connected to government networks or the internet. You can connect this mail service through you normal mail applications (for example, Microsoft Outlook), to send and receive mail as well as use lightweight collaborative features. This Getting Started Guide walks you through the process of configuring your Email and Collaboration service. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to set up their Email and Collaboration as a Service. To complete the steps in this guide you must have login credentials for an administrator account and access to the Zimbra administration console. Introduction to Email and Collaboration as a Service The Zimbra Collaboration Suite that underpins UKCloud's email offering provides a wide range of client connectivity options. An advanced webmail client allows the full feature set within the suite to be accessed from anywhere that internet connectivity is available and from virtually any platform via a wide-range of supported browsers A cross-platform desktop application is provided extending the functionality of the web client by enabling email to be read and composed while offline IMAP and POP3 clients are supported Calendar and contacts can be accessed via the CalDav and CardDav protocols Full Microsoft Outlook integration is supported using the Zimbra Collaboration Suite Connector for Outlook, which utilizes a full MAPI provider that leverages the Microsoft-standard MAPI interface for contacts, calendar, and other functionality not supported by IMAP or POP The service provides enterprise-class functionality for end-users, on a per-mailbox, per- month pricing model. It offers several options for mailbox access, including POP3, IMAP4 and SMTP --- all with TLS (SSL) encryption --- as well as HTTPS. Exchange ActiveSync is also supported. Although the service was designed with end-users in mind, there's nothing to stop you using the supported protocols to allow an application to access a mailbox in order to send or receive email. This will generally be achieved via SMTP or POP3 over TLS. It's worth noting that there's a minimum commitment of 25 mailboxes with this service --- but they don't all have to be used. Before you begin To start using the Email and Collaboration service, you first need to decide on a domain name, which must be a real-world, registered domain name. You can use a new domain name, or simply delegate a sub-domain of your organisation's existing domain name. You'll need to configure your chosen domain's MX record as mail.skyscapecs.net . Once you've decided on a domain name and submitted your service request, UKCloud will configure your domain name on our platform and create an administrator account. You'll receive a welcome email with details of your administrator account with delegated rights for your email domain. This account will usually be in the following format: admin@ yourdomain For example: admin@example.com You'll receive the account details as part of the onboarding process; we recommend that you change the account's password immediately. This is the account you'll use to create mailboxes on the platform. You'll need to create a mailbox for each email address you want to be able to send or receive from. Supported browsers Refer to the Zimbra Collaboration Supported Systems document for the most up to date list, at: https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/8.7.0/Supported_Systems Firefox and Chrome on Windows, Mac, Linux Internet Explorer on Windows Safari on Mac and Windows Accessing the Zimbra administration console The Zimbra administration console is a browser-based user interface for managing your mailbox server and mailbox accounts. The way you access the administration console depends on which security domain you use: The Assured OFFICIAL console is accessible from the internet or via the PSN Assured network (depending on the service selected) The Elevated OFFICIAL console is accessible only via the PSN Protected network (and other interconnecting networks) We'll provide you with the URL for the administration console along with your account details. Creating a user account Creating a user account sets up the appropriate entries in the LDAP directory server. When the user logs in for the first time, or when the first email is delivered to the user's account, the mailbox is created on the mailbox server. To create a user account: In the administration console, select Manage and then Accounts . Click the gear symbol in the top-right of the main panel and select New . Enter an Account name and the user's Last name . (The other fields are optional.) If the new account will be an administrator, select the Administrator checkbox in the Account Setup section. Scroll down to set the initial Password then click Next . Enter the new user's contact information then click Next . Enter any aliases required for the account then click Next . Add the account to any required distribution lists then click Next . If the account is an administrator account, you need to add it to the administration group at this point, to grant the necessary rights within the domain. To do this: In the Find field under Add distribution lists to the account , enter admingroup and click Search . Select the resulting admingroup@yourdomain . Click Add at the bottom of the dialog box to make the new account a member of the group. Specify any forwarding rules. Click Finish to complete creation of the account. The user can log in to and use the account immediately. It will take up to an hour to add the account to the Global Address List, during which time the account name won't be listed as an auto-complete option for users composing emails. Getting to know the Zimbra web client Zimbra offers standard HTML, advanced JavaScript, and mobile web clients that you can log into. The web clients include mail, calendar, address book, and task functionality. You can select the client to use when you log in. The advanced web client includes Ajax capability and offers a full set of web collaboration features. This web client works best with newer browsers and fast internet connections. The standard web client is a good option when internet connections are slow or if you prefer HTML-based messaging for navigating within your mailbox. The mobile web client provides an experience optimized for smaller screen formats available on mobile devices. Typically when you log in, you'll see the advanced Zimbra web client. You can switch to a different version if you prefer by using the Version list on the login screen. If the Zimbra web client detects that the screen resolution is 800x600, you're automatically redirected to the standard web client. You can still select the advanced web client but will see a warning message suggesting the use of the standard client for a better screen view. When connecting to Zimbra using a mobile web browser, Zimbra will automatically detect and default to the mobile web client. To access the Zimbra web client: Go to the following location: https://mail.skyscapecs.net/ Log in using your account's email address and password.

This can be referred to as an electronic mailshot. IMAP The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is a mail protocol used for accessing email on a remote web server from a local client. LDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is an Internet protocol that email and other programs use to look up information from a server. LDAP is mostly used by medium-to-large organisations. POP POP stands for Post Office Protocol. POP3 is version 3 of the protocol. When an e-mail is sent to your address, it is stored on the mail server until it is downloaded via your e-mail client (Outlook, your mobile, etc.) using POP3. After the e-mail has been downloaded to your client, it is removed from the server altogether. SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is used when email is delivered from an email client, such as Outlook Express, to an email server or when email is delivered from one email server to another. SMTP uses port 25. TLS Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), both frequently referred to as \"SSL\", are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network.

    "keywords": "How to view Cloud Storage information in the UKCloud Portal Overview Cloud Storage is UKCloud's object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Although you'll mostly interact with Cloud Storage through the API, the UKCloud Portal provides access to some information about your service. Within the UKCloud Portal you can: View information about the namespaces within your Cloud Storage environment View a list of users with access to a namespace Reset the secret key for a Cloud Storage user View information about the buckets within a namespace View a graphical representation of the storage consumed over the last 30 days Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have been granted access to the relevant namespace. Granting Portal permissions for Cloud Storage To view Cloud Storage information in the Portal, users must be granted access to the relevant namespace. Once access is granted, the user will be able to see the namespace, list the buckets in the namespace and reset the secret key. They will also be able to see consumption data for namespaces and buckets, with a graphical representation of average consumption for buckets. To grant Portal permissions for Cloud Storage: Log in to the UKCloud Portal and select your account. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . In the Portal navigation panel, expand the CONTACTS option and select All Contacts . Find the contact for whom you want to grant permissions and click the Edit button. Click the Permissions tab. Scroll down to the Permissions for Cloud Storage section and select the Access check box for the relevant namespace. Viewing namespace and bucket information In ECS, objects are stored in buckets. In the UKCloud Portal, you can drill down through your namespaces to see the allocated buckets available in your Cloud Storage service. You can also view storage consumption over the last 30 days. Note It's not possible to view objects within the UKCloud Portal. Log in to the UKCloud Portal and select your account. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Cloud Storage option and select ECS . The Storage tab lists the namespaces within the currently selected account. You can see: The number of buckets in the namespace The total amount of storage (in GiB) currently consumed by the objects in all the buckets in the namespace The service level of the namespace: STANDARD --- data is stored in a single data centre ENHANCED --- data is stored in a primary named data centre and copied to a second geographically remote data centre To list the buckets in a namespace, click the Buckets button for the namespace. On the Buckets tab, you can see the following information for each bucket in the selected namespace: The type of bucket: S3 or ATMOS The total amount of storage (in GiB) currently consumed by the objects in the bucket The number of objects in the bucket To view a graph that shows the amount of storage (in GiB) consumed by the objects in the bucket over the last 30 days, click the Show Consumption button for the bucket. Resetting your secret key Each user who can access Cloud Storage has an associated secret key to enable secure authentication. When attempting to access Cloud Storage, you must specify the appropriate secret key. If you forget the secret key for your user ID, you can reset it in the UKCloud Portal. Note For security purposes, the UKCloud Portal does not display secret keys, if you forget your secret key, you must reset it to generate a new one. Log in to the UKCloud Portal and select your account. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . In the Portal navigation panel, expand the Cloud Storage option and select ECS . Click the Users button for the namespace for which you want to reset the secret key. The Users tab lists the different user IDs associated with the namespace. Click the Reset Secret button next to the appropriate user ID. Click OK to confirm that you want to reset the secret key.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Cloud Storage Introduction UKCloud's Cloud Storage service is an object storage solution based on Dell EMC Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS). Access is via a RESTful application programming interface (API), which also provides support for Amazon's S3 API. This Getting Started Guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Cloud Storage up and running in your environment. It also looks at common use cases for API‑based object storage within web applications and provides information about some command-line tools that you can use to interact with the storage APIs. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to learn more about UKCloud's Cloud Storage service. Cloud Storage overview Cloud Storage: Is a secure and highly adaptable storage platform designed to address a wide variety of use cases Is based on object storage technology that is natively optimised for cloud storage in terms of scale, resilience and accessibility Removes the complexity of capacity management by utilising a pay‑as‑you‑go model, so you pay for what you use, when you use it, scaling indefinitely and on demand Natively enables application deduplication and redundancy to ensure the highest level of data availability, while reducing the cost and management of on-premises storage solutions Provides easy access to storage anywhere, anytime, to any device, using HTTP(S) to simplify the integration of object storage systems into cloud‑based solutions by removing the need to rely on the availability of web, file or FTP servers Offloads objects (files, media, images) from compute resources, reducing the load on server resources Automatically replicates and distributes objects to give high levels of data durability and availability, eliminating the need for cloud backup and recovery ECS provides two APIs that you can use to manage your cloud storage: the S3‑compatible API and the EMC ECS Atmos API. Note If you write content to cloud storage using one of the APIs, you cannot subsequently access that content using the other API. Choose carefully which API you want to use before beginning a project, as it will be difficult to move between them. The key differences between the two APIs are: The ECS S3-compatible API enables you to easily migrate applications between Atmos, S3 and other S3‑compatible storage; but not all functionality available in S3 is available on ECS as shown in the S3 Supported Features chapter of the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide ). The ECS Atmos API provides backward compatibility with the EMC Atmos platform. It offers access to the majority of the features of the platform with certain exceptions as listed in the Atmos Supported Features chapter of the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide . Cloud Storage use cases The low cost of cloud storage per GB, as well as its almost unlimited scalability, means there's a large variety of use cases for it. For example, it's ideal for data archives, backups, log files, and media repositories. We anticipate that most web applications can make good use of cloud storage for static content, such as images and downloadable binaries. Storing these items in cloud storage --- rather than in primary storage attached to web servers, inside the database or on a traditional file share --- can provide significant benefits in terms of cost savings, agility and performance. For example, with an internet-facing application that enables users to download forms and guides in PDF, these items are often stored in primary storage attached to the web servers, which creates several challenges: Whenever a PDF is updated, the updated copy must be replicated to all web servers When an item is downloaded, the bandwidth usage of the web server in question increases Multiple simultaneous downloads could overload the web servers or other components of the network infrastructure Each object is stored multiple times in primary storage, increasing the overall cost of storage On the other hand, storing this content in cloud storage overcomes these challenges because: Only one copy of each item is stored, so updates only need to be made in one place End users connect directly to cloud storage to download PDFs, bypassing the web servers and associated network infrastructure Objects are stored only once, and at a much lower price per GB, which substantially reduces the overall cost of storage The same principles apply to other static content, such as images and (especially) videos. The more workload you can offload onto an external system such as cloud storage, the leaner your application infrastructure can become. There are often questions around how best to implement this. Ultimately, it's up to the application developers, but a popular approach is as follows: Handle content uploads and creation on the web servers. Perform any required modifications or transformations using on-demand processing servers (usually from a message queue). Write the content into cloud storage, storing the resulting object IDs, external URLs and any other relevant metadata in the application database. This process provides a relatively simple transition to cloud storage. The application still knows about all the objects, but rather than retrieving, for example, a relative path for an item from the database, its entire URL is retrieved, pointing to cloud storage. Before you begin When you request your Cloud Storage service, UKCloud Support creates a namespace in the specified account. If you have requested an Atmos subtenant, this is also created. To create S3 buckets, use any S3-compliant tool. To create additional namespaces or Atmos subtenants, you must raise a service request. You can have S3 buckets and Atmos subtentants in the same namespace. Cloud Storage provides different API endpoints to access your storage, depending on the UKCloud site and connectivity type you are using. Make sure you use the correct endpoint to ensure the best possible performance for your solution. S3 API endpoint Atmos API endpoint Corsham (Assured) Internet cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com PSN Assured cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.cor00005.psnassured.ukcloud.com N3 cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ Farnborough (Assured) Internet cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.com PSN Assured cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com atmos.cas.frn00006.psnassured.ukcloud.com N3 cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ atmos.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk/ If you're using the ENHANCED option (geo-resilient storage), you can use either the Corsham or Farnborough endpoints. In the event of a site failure, there will be an outage to objects created on the failed site. UKCloud will bring these objects online in the other site within about 15 minutes. Contact UKCloud support if you are unsure which endpoint to use. Using the ECS S3-compatible API The S3-compatible API is at: https:// api_endpoint Check which api_endpoint to use in Before you begin , for example: https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com To help get you started, you can find developer resources on the Amazon web site at: http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/s3/ For details of the supported and unsupported S3 operations on ECS, see: https://www.emc.com/techpubs/ecs/ecs_s3_supported_features-1.htm You may also find the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide useful: https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu79368.pdf Note Currently the N3 DNS service does not allow UKCloud to create wildcard DNS entries for our services. This means that S3 URLs that feature the bucket as part of the domain do not work (for example, bucket01.cas.frn00006.ukcloud.thirdparty.nhs.uk ). With most S3 tools, you can choose whether to use prefix buckets or suffix buckets. If you are using the service via N3 you'll need to make sure your client tools support suffix buckets. Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl The Amazon S3 Authentication Tool for Curl (S3Curl) is a very useful Perl script, developed by Amazon. It's a wrapper for Curl that calculates the required authentication signature automatically for each request. As the authentication signature changes for every request, this allows Curl to interact with the API outside of code, enabling you to validate that your commands are working correctly and view the raw HTML response from the API, which can be useful when troubleshooting. For more information about S3Curl, see http://aws.amazon.com/code/128 . To use S3Curl: Download S3Curl from the following location: https://github.com/UKCloud/s3curl Install the following required dependency: sudo apt-get install libdigest-hmac-perl yum install perl-Digest-HMAC Create a file named .s3curl in the home directory containing your credentials. For example: %awsSecretAccessKeys = ( UKCloud => { id => '*user_id*', key => '*secret_key*', }, ); Where: user_id is your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) secret_key is your secret key (If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Change the permissions, otherwise the Perl script will refuse to run. chmod 600 .s3curl Make the following small modification to the script itself so that it will work correctly with ECS: Open the s3curl.pl file in your preferred editor (for example, vim or nano). Scroll down until you find the following comment: # begin customizing here The S3 endpoints are defined below this line, so add your Cloud Storage host name to this list as follows: my @endpoints = ('*api_endpoint*', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... For example: #begin customizing here my @endpoints = ('cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com', 's3.amazonaws.com', ... Save the file. S3Curl is now ready to use, so you can call it as follows: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- *curl_arguments* The curl_arguments need to contain the host name and port number. For example, to list your buckets, you could use: perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/ Or to delete a file named Lighthouse.jpg in /bucket2 : perl s3curl.pl --id UKCloud -- -X DELETE https://cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com/bucket2/Lighthouse.jpg Using the ECS Atmos API The Atmos API is at: https:// api_endpoint Check which api_endpoint to use in Before you begin , for example: https://atmos.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com To help get you started, download the appropriate Atmos SDK from the following location: https://community.emc.com/docs/DOC-27910 The SDK provides bindings for all popular languages, as well as some quick start guides. You can find the full API reference in the EMC Atmos Programmer's Guide , which you can download from the following location (or the UKCloud Knowledge Centre): https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu68370.pdf For details of the supported and unsupported Atmos operations on ECS, see: https://www.emc.com/techpubs/ecs/ecs_atmos_supported_features-1.htm You may also find the Elastic Cloud Storage (ECS) Data Access Guide useful: https://www.emc.com/collateral/TechnicalDocument/docu79368.pdf Using a command-line interface Interacting with Cloud Storage via the API directly is ideal for web-based applications, but having access from the command line can help developers with testing and provide scripting access to Cloud Storage. Command‑line interface (CLI) tools enable access from the command line by translating commands into the relevant API calls. There are lots of CLI tools to choose from --- this guide examines two for the S3 API: one each for Linux and Windows. Remember that the APIs are not interchangeable, so if you use the Atmos API in your application, you won't be able to see the data using the S3 CLI. Using S3cmd --- a Linux CLI for the S3 API S3cmd is an open-source tool for Linux, written in Python. To use S3cmd: Download and extract the S3cmd files from the following location: http://s3tools.org/download Create the required configuration files by running the following command: s3cmd ---configure When prompted, provide the following information: Access Key --- your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Secret Key --- your secret key (If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) Encryption password --- create a secure password Path to GPG program --- as appropriate for your system Use HTTPS protocol --- Yes You'll be prompted to test the connection. After the test, even if it fails, save the configuration, which will be written to ~/.s3cfg . Edit the ~/.s3cfg file and confirm that the host_base and host_bucket lines look like the following: host_base = api_endpoint host_bucket = %(bucket)s. api_endpoint Note Ensure that you use the appropriate api_endpoint , as shown in Before you begin , for example: host_base = cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com host_bucket = %(bucket)s.cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com Save the file. The S3cmd tool is now ready to use. To list your buckets, run the following command: s3cmd ls You can find detailed instructions for using the tool in the accompanying README file. Using S3Express--- a Windows CLI for the S3 API S3Express is a lightweight command-line tool for Windows that is self-contained in a single executable. It's a licensed product, with free trials also available. To use S3Express: Download and install the S3Express files from the following location: http://www.s3express.com/ Use the following commands to configure the tool to access Cloud Storage: saveauth user_id secret_key UKCloud setopt --endpoint: api_endpoint Where: user_id is your User ID (you can find this in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) secret_key is your secret key (If you've forgotten or don't know your secret key, you can reset it in the Storage section of the UKCloud Portal) api_endpoint is the appropriate endpoint, as shown in Before you begin , for example: setopt --endpoint:cas.cor00005.ukcloud.com The S3Express tool is now ready to use. To list your buckets, run the following command: ls For detailed instructions, refer to the Windows help file, which is installed along with the tool. Working with Cloud Storage in the UKCloud Portal Although you will mostly interact with your Cloud Storage service through the API, the UKCloud Portal provides access to some information about your service. Within the UKCloud Portal, you can: View information about the namespaces within your Cloud Storage environment, including: How many buckets are in each namespace Storage consumed by each namespace View a list of users with access to the namespace Reset the secret key for a user View information about the buckets within a namespace, including: API Type: Atmos or S3 Storage consumed by the bucket Number of objects in the bucket View a graphical representation of the storage consumed by a bucket over the last 30 days More information!

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for the Cross Domain Security Zone Walled Garden Introduction The UKCloud Walled Garden provides self-service access to the Cross Domain Security Zone (CDSZ) so that you can design, implement and manage your own cross‑domain solution, using technology and application services of your choice. UKCloud provides an assurance wrap by managing firewalls between the security domains and ensuring you use appropriate risk management to understand and mitigate identified risks. The Walled Garden is ideal if you require more control and flexibility over what is passed between security domains, to support a wider range of use cases. This guide covers the steps you need to follow to get your Walled Garden up and running. Intended audience This guide is intended for customers who have: Completed the CDSZ Walled Garden assurance wrap Been approved to have a Base Implementation of the Walled Garden to allow data to pass between the Assured and Elevated security domains on the UKCloud platform Before you begin Before you can start to implement a walled garden, you must have completed and passed the appropriate assurance wrap. For more information, see the UKCloud Walled Garden assurance wrap and application form . After your Walled Garden assurance wrap has been approved, a service request is raised to implement the Walled Garden virtual data centre (VDC) and, if necessary, Elevated and Assured VDCs. Note If a service request for this implementation already exists, the existing request is used and a new one is not raised. You can track the progress of the service request in the My Calls section of the UKCloud Portal. During the provisioning of the Walled Garden service, we'll ask you for some additional information via the service request: The customer account in which you would like the Walled Garden VDC to be provisioned, if different from the customer completing the Walled Garden application form. Whether you plan to have a single or dual site solution. How many VDCs you need to be set up in each security domain. If you're connecting new or existing VDCs to the Walled Garden VDC. If you're connecting to existing VDCs, we'll need to know information such as NFT details, customer account, and so on. The external source IP addresses from which you'd like to access the Assured VDC (up to a maximum of 50). These IP addresses are the locations from which you can build and test the environment (for example, offices or end user premises). The build phase of the Walled Garden environment can take up to 10 working days depending on the complexity of the deployment. When the environment has been fully provisioned, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will send you the information you need to access it. Building your Walled Garden service As soon as you have access to your environment, you can start to build your Walled Garden services. You then have 42 calendar days to: Complete the provisioning of the virtual machines (VMs) and networking Complete an IT Health Check Present your evidence pack to the customer and UKCloud SIROs It is important to remember that while the UKCloud Portal for the Assured security domain is accessible from the internet, the Portal for the Elevated security domain and Walled Garden services is accessible only through the PSN Protected network or through UKCloud's Secure Remote Access service. Setting up your networking First, you need to replicate the networking that you set out in your Walled Garden application form diagrams. This involves the creation of external and internal networking, as well as the creation of rules on the virtual firewall within your environment. For information about creating networks and firewall rules, see the How to build a virtual machines with UKCloud for VMware and Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . You also need to create the rules that allow connectivity between the different VDCs through the Walled Garden. This involves the creation of firewall rules, static routes and/or NAT rules. Networking examples There are two options for networking between the VDCs in the Walled Garden service: Option 1: Create static routes between the VDCs; this is the simplest option for connecting VDCs Option 2: Use NAT rules on top of the static routes; this option may be appropriate if you want to abstract the static routes The diagrams below provide examples for both options. Note For both options: You cannot route public IP addresses to the vCNS Edges in the Walled Garden The Org VDC networks 192.168.XXX.XX in the examples below are illustrative and you should replace these with your own details You must have one VM in the Walled Garden VDC connecting to both vCNS Edges Each of the examples below assumes that the appropriate firewall rules are in place You must apply an SNAT rule in the Elevated security domain to enable connectivity to UKCloud services Building your virtual machines The next step is to build the VMs that you outlined in the Walled Garden application form. This involves deploying the VMs from either the vCloud Director catalog or from template VMs as OVF files. The VMs must be able to access UKCloud services, such as OS repositories, the network time server, the Key Management Server (KMS), and so on. You may also need to access external services, such as antivirus repositories. You must configure this access in your VDC networking. For more information about creating VMs and accessing UKCloud services, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware . Testing your environment When you've built your VMs and networking, you can start to test the environment. If you've configured the networking correctly, your VMs should be able to talk to each other across the Walled Garden. If you have any issues, check your network rules. Performing the IT Health Check As part of the Base Implementation, you're required to conduct an IT Health Check (ITHC) of the environment. The ITHC must be conducted by an independent CHECK Service Provider, approved and classified as Green Light by the National Cyber Security Centre (NSCS). You can search for appropriate providers on the NSCS web site . Before beginning the ITHC, notify UKCloud by raising a service request in My Calls and completing the External Security Review Test (ESRT) application form . Ideally, we require five working days' notice before the work is due to be carried out. The ITHC scope should be relevant to the environment. For example, if you're using the Walled Garden to pull application and antivirus updates from the internet, then security controls relevant to facilitate this should be in scope. Bear in mind that the end customer accreditor may dictate the scope of the ITHC. Presenting your results When you've conducted your ITHC, with no results higher than Medium, present your evidence pack to the UKCloud SIRO. The evidence pack comprises the Walled Garden assurance wrap form and the following, as detailed in sections (a) to (c) in section 3.7 of the Walled Garden assurance wrap form: (a) Evidence of protective monitoring aligning with the 12 Protective Monitoring Controls (PMCs) in Good Practice Guide 13 (GPG13). The protective monitoring will need to span both sides of the Walled Garden as well as the Walled Garden itself. You can provide this by explaining how each of the PMCs is met by the protective monitoring solution in place. (b) The ITHC results, with no risks higher than a Medium. If you do have results higher than a Medium but you have put a remediation plan in place that has been accepted by the end customer accreditor, then we may accept this depending on the issues raised. (c) An approval statement confirming that the end customer accreditor is satisfied with the overall security regime and is happy for the solution to be live. If the information provided in the Walled Garden evidence pack is acceptable, the UKCloud SIRO signs off the Live Implementation and any restrictions that have been imposed on the environment by UKCloud Customer Service are lifted.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Secure Remote Access Overview Intended audience This document is for customers who have: Completed the UKCloud Assurance Wrap Been approved to use the Secure Remote Access (SRA) service to manage services in the Elevated OFFICIAL security domain on the UKCloud platform Post approval Once the SRA Assurance Wrap has been approved, we'll raise a service request for the implementation of the SRA virtual data centre (vDC) and, if needed, an Elevated (formerly IL3) vDC. (If a service request for this vDC implementation already exists, a new one won't be raised.) You can track the progress of the service request using the UKCloud Portal. During creation of the UKCloud SRA vDC, we'll ask you for some additional information via the service request: Confirm the customer account number in Elevated as a new Org will be created under the account to contain the SRA vDC. The Org number will be used as an identifier when signing certificates. The preferred IP pool you want to use for your client devices. If the IP Pool you'd prefer is in use by another customer then another will have to be chosen. We'll inform you if this is the case. If you want to specify an IP from the IP pool for each device, we'll need you to supply the mapping. Any specified DNS servers. The Elevated Network Firewall Tenant (NFT) number and the Elevated organisation containing it for connection into Elevated. A certificate signing request for each remote access device. Certificate signing request generation To enable SRA access, we'll need the certificate-signing request (CSR) from each remote access device you'll be using. The certificate-generation process will vary depending on the OS of the client device. Windows Follow the steps below to generate the CSR for a Windows device. Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, double-click Personal and then click Certificates . On the Actions menu, point to All Tasks , point to Advanced Options and then click Create Custom Request to start the Certificate Enrolment wizard. Click Next . On the Custom request page, in the Templates list, we recommend using the Custom Request option as your domain policy may be incompatible with the SRA service. Select Proceed without enrolment policy and click Next . Select (No template) CNG key and ensure the PKCS#10 radio button is selected, then click Next . At the Certificate Information page, click the down arrow next to Details then click the Properties button. Click the Private Key tab, then the down arrow to the right of Key options . Change the Key size to 2048 and click Apply . Optional: If you want to back up the certificate (to protect against client device failure) click the check boxes for the private key . You'll be asked for a password. For the file format, select Base 64 and then save the CSR. Linux For Linux, an equivalent OpenSSL command would be the following: openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myserver.key -out server.csr Ensure that the key file is preserved for the later installation steps below, as withouth this the AnyConnect client will not be able to connect the SRA service. CSR submission to UKCloud We request that you paste the contents of the CSR file directly into a ticket for us to generate the associated certificate(s), but you can also email it to us if you cannot access the Portal. VPN Cisco AnyConnect client setup To access yoru SRA VDC you need to download the Cisco AnyConnect client and install it on your remote access devices. For each OS there is the main Cisco AnyConnect client software install and an additional executable to enable the FIPS capability. You need to run both. Linux Download link https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/a0e452d8-cd7b-49a4-a3ca-f791620cb084 Install the AnyConnect client tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-k9.tar.gz cd anyconnect-<version number>-/vpn sudo ./vpn_install.sh Enable FIPS tar zxvf anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS.tar.gz ./ anyconnect-linux-64-<version number>-enableFIPS Windows Download link https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/9af4958c-04c0-4ae1-8eb2-2733dc8042ce Install the AnyConnect client The windows installation has the option of .msi or .iso (that contains the .msi ) for the AnyConnect client image. The following installs may need to be run as administrator depending on the local policy of your Windows device. Right click on the anyconnect-win-<version number>-pre-deploy.msi and select Install. Enable FIPS Double click anyconnect-EnableFIPS-win-<version number>.exe and then enter y when asked at the command prompt. Mac Download link https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/e8b2d284-ec20-45e4-aed6-5a6071299064 AnyConnect client software We'll make the latest Cisco AnyConnect client software available via the Knowledge Centre using the links above. Using the latest version of the AnyConnect client will probably be a requirement of your ITSHC or service assurance wrap so it will be worth checking the above articles periodically. If a client is upgraded from a previous install then the following post installation steps will need to be performed again to ensure the client configuration isn't reverted to the default. Post-installation configuration Once you've installed the AnyConnect software and certificates on your device, you need to install the connection profile which is available in the Knowledge Centre ( https://portal.skyscapecloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/25a7111c-139e-4fd2-a52c-3412689bf1d3 ). Unzip the file and copy the xml to the following location: OS type CPA XML location Linux/Mac /opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile Windows C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco\\Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client\\Profile For Linux only In addition to the AnyConnect profile, you also need to install a local policy which is available in the Knowledge Centre: https://portal.ukcloud.com/support/knowledge_centre/2effd0b2-1eda-4999-87a6-6140e5fc07ea Unzip the file and copy it to: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml . Once you've copied the connection profile and local policy to the correct locations, you need to restart the AnyConnect service (using the command service vpnagentd restart ) or reboot the VM. SRA certificates Once the SRA vDC has been set up (and Elevated vDC, if needed), we'll send you an email containing the certificates we've generated (based on the CSR sent to us as above) which you need to install onto your remote access devices. For each customer SRA service a unique IssuingCA certificate is generated and used to sign each individual device certificates. The IssuingCA certificate along with the specific certificate for the device will be emailed. Both the certificates need to be installed. The certificates sent through will named as below: IssuingCA – clientcert.pem Device Certificate - E51FFC7D50C<HEX VALUE>.pem Windows certificate store Follow the steps below to import the certificates into the Windows certificate store. This assumes that you have the certificates we sent accessible to the MMC: Open the Certificates MMC snap-in (click Start , click Run , type mmc , and then press Enter ) select Certificates and then Computer Account . In the console tree, open Trusted Root Certification Authorities , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the IssuingCA sent to you, double click clientcert.pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Trusted Root Certification Authorities selected then click Next then Finish . In the console tree, open Personal , right click Certificates and select All tasks – Import - Next . Click Browse , change the filter from **X.509 Certificate ( .cer, .crt) to All files . Find the device certificate sent to you, double click E51FFC7D50C .pem and click Next . Ensure that the Place all certificates radio button has Personal selected then click Next then Finish . Using the example customer SRAS-1-1-2 you should now see the client certificate in the Personal store. Double click it and as in the examples pictures below: In the General tab it should say \"You have a private key that corresponds to this certificate\". The UID should be displayed the Details tab in the Subject line in the format SRAS-1-1-2- The certification path listed in the Certification Path tab as highlighted in the example below should show the IssuingCA Linux certificate store The Linux certificate store is just a file structure under the root or user account depending on how you use Linux OS. For the Linux client to work the following must be true: All certificate files must end with the extension .pem All private key files must end with the extension .key A client certificate and its corresponding private key must have the same filename. For example client.pem and client.key Using the example customer issued certificate SRAS1-1-2-001.pem the files would be stored in the following locations for root. The key file generated above needs to moved and renamed appropriately. PEM file certificate store folders Type of certificates stored ~/.cisco/certificates/client/private/SRAS1-1-2-001.key Private keys ~/.cisco/certificates/client/SRAS1-1-2-001.pem Client certificates ~/.cisco/certificates/ca/clientcert.pem Trusted CA and root certificates Connecting to SRA Once connected to your SRA VPN, you can access your SRA walled garden via IP address or DNS name (if you have a DNS set up). Client connection methods are listed below. Linux Once you've restarted AnyConnect and installed the certificates, you can use the client with the following command line: /opt/cisco/anyconnect/bin/vpn connect sra01.ukcloud.com Or if you use a Linux desktop the client software should be available as an icon. Windows When you open the AnyConnect client you'll see a small window appear and the location of the SRA service should be populated: Click the Connect button and after a couple of status checks the client should scan the certificate store and offer the relevant certificate to initiate access. Select the certificate and click OK . Accessing the UKCloud Portal using SRA There is no direct access to the Elevated portal once the AnyConnect client connects. In most instances we'll create a virtual machine (VM) within the SRA VDC that you can VPN into in order to log in to the Elevated portal to provision and manage your SRA and Elevated VDC. Once this VM is deployed, it becomes your responsibility to manage and maintain it. This VM will be billed according to standard UKCloud billing process. Addresses to hit the Elevated portal and vCloud Director API can be obtained by raising a support ticket through the UKCloud Portal.

    "keywords": "Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud platform Overview To get the best interaction with the UKCloud platform, it's important to use a browser that is compatible with all aspects of the services with which you interact. This document outlines the browser requirement for UKCloud services. UKCloud for VMware For UKCloud for VMware, we recommend that you use the Mozilla Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR 52) 32-bit browser. This browser is supported by both the UKCloud Portal and by the Web Console for vCloud Director 8.20 (the version used by UKCloud for VMware). Firefox ESR 52 is an older version of Firefox, updated with new security patches, that remains compatible with the plugin type that the vCloud Director Web Console uses on our platform. You can find Firefox ESR at: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/ Note Make sure you download ESR 52, which is the last ESR release to support legacy add-ons. Support for ESR 52 ends in August 2018, but by this time we will have upgraded UKCloud for VMware to vCloud Director 9.1, which will eliminate the need for the Web Console plugin. For more information, see https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/10/03/legacy-add-on-support-on-firefox-esr/ . You should also make sure that you download the 32-bit version of the browser. Although Internet Explorer 8. x , 9. x and 10. x are supported by the vCloud Director 8.20 Web Console, if you've applied any group policy restrictions you may encounter problems. The vCloud Director Web Console has the following additional requirements: Adobe Flash Player version 11.2 or later (32-bit version only) Note This is a known issue with Adobe Flash Player version 27.0.0.170. If you encounter problems, make sure you update to version 27.0.0.183 or later. JRE 1.6.0 update 10 or later installed and enabled (32-bit version only) Note VMware are redeveloping the Flash-based UI for vCloud Director and replacing it with a fully-featured HTML5-based interface. The first part of this redeveloped UI (provding HTML5 options for advanced networking features) has been made available in vCloud Director 8.20. More features will move to an HTML5-based UI in future releases. UKCloud for OpenStack UKCloud for OpenStack is powered by OpenStack and uses the Horizon project to provide its dashboard capabilities. Horizon is built around modern HTML5 standards and requires no auxiliary plugins to operate. Therefore, it is compatible with all latest browser versions. UKCloud for Microsoft Azure Interaction with UKCloud for Microsoft Azure is through the Azure Stack portal. Microsoft recommends using the most up-to-date browser for your operating system. Cloud GPU Cloud GPU has the same browser requirements as UKCloud for VMware . High Performance Compute High Performance Compute has the same browser requirements as UKCloud for VMware . #Email and Collaboration as a Service For the most up to date list of supported browsers for Email and Collaboration as a Service, refer to the Zimbra Collaboration Supported Systems document.

    "title": "UKCloud for Oracle Software Service Scope | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "UKCloud for Oracle Software About this document This document describes the boundaries of the UKCloud for Oracle software service, along with the division of responsibilities between UKCloud and the customer, to facilitate the provisioning and ongoing use of the service. About UKCloud for Oracle Software The UKCloud for Oracle Software service provides a secure, scalable and cost-effective platform for hosting Oracle virtual machines (OVMs) of various sizes. You can use the platform to build new services quickly and securely; and migrate, augment or transform existing Oracle-based applications. The platform is immediately available so you can provision and scale OVMs in minutes. Service architecture Your UKCloud service architecture is as follows: Company. Your contract with UKCloud is associated with a company, which provides a single owner for the contract, regardless of how many accounts are created. Account. We use accounts to separate financial ownership. An account could represent an organisation, a customer contract, or a specific project. An account can also have several UKCloud services associated with it, such as UKCloud for Oracle, Cloud Storage and UKCloud for OpenStack. You can also use accounts to separate users based on access requirements or permissions. Organisation. This represents your UKCloud for Oracle Software service inside Oracle Enterprise Manager and on the UKCloud Portal. There is a 1:1 mapping of service to Organisation. Oracle Tenant. An Oracle Tenant is where you define your workload type and build your OVMs. You can create Oracle Tenants via a service request. Service configuration The UKCloud for Oracle Software infrastructure is uncontended and configured to optimise the performance and availability of Oracle workloads. There is only one service configuration on the UKCloud for Oracle Software platform, ensuring that OVMs are pinned to cores to stop OVM movement that would unbalance applications. Customers can self-configure OVMs by the number of cores, and amount of memory and storage needed. OVMs can be reconfigured to adjust resources in line with changing performance requirements. Self-service management is done through the Oracle Enterprise Management Portal, accessed through the UKCloud Portal. Full details of the available service options are outlined in the Service Definition ( Assured | Elevated ). Storage options All storage is persistent and resilient to local hardware failures. Multiple storage options can be used to support different aspects of the application. Tier 1. Fast storage ideal for data warehouses, fast transactional databases or randomly executing workloads. Tier 2. General all-purpose storage, suitable for systems with human interactions or predictable work patterns. Cloud Storage. Ideal for serving media content or as a medium-term repository; can be used to store Recovery Manager (RMAN) backups. Storage policies We provide you with access to two storage policies: tier 1 and tier 2. We will initially provide you with a tier 2 storage policy, however you can request tier 1 storage be added to your Oracle Tenant so you can create additional disks with tier 1 storage on your OVMs. VM templates come with a 50GiB system disk and a secondary disk (equivalent to the size of the RAM associated with the OVM - up to 16GiB). These virtual disks are mapped from the tier 2 VM repository by default. For installations of Oracle apps on top of the OS, it's best to have separate non-OS virtual disks which are then mapped to mountpoints. The sizing requirements/recommendations for the non-OS storage can be found on the official Oracle installation guides and they can differ from version to version. You will need to take into consideration future data growth while planning capacity, as this would also reflect on the capacity required for backups. We do not guarantee storage performance, as it can be affected by many factors. We do not provide IOPS figures for our storage offerings. Workloads can use multiple storage profiles. Protection UKCloud for Oracle Software does not include any infrastructure-level backup or disaster recovery functionality. However, the underpinning infrastructure supports native Oracle protection technologies such as Data Guard and RMAN. UKCloud's Cloud Storage can be used as an S3-addressable target for Oracle protection technologies. Service availability UKCloud for Oracle Software offers an SLA guarantee of 99.95% availability. You are entitled to claim Service Credits for outages to services that take you out of the SLA. For more about how we calculate SLAs, see the SLA Definition document. Our SLA does not cover faults within your control, such as client application issues, or faults within external connectivity providers (for example, internet, PSN or N3/HSCN). Service background UKCloud's UKCloud for Oracle software platform is underpinned by Oracle compute infrastructure. UKCloud manage the physical infrastructure and utilise our partner, Infomentum, to provide support and management from the hypervisor level and above. Infomentum will provision your Oracle Tenant environment and UKCloud will present it to you through the Oracle Enterprise Manager. You will be responsible for OVM creation and maintenance. All service requests will be triaged by UKCloud. We reserve the right to escalate a request to Infomentum for support. If you have not have a managed service contract with Infomentum, please do not contact them directly. UKCloud actively capacity-manages the cloud platform to ensure you have access to the resources you request. The UKCloud platform is designed using sites, regions and zones. The relationship between them is shown below: You can specify Farnborough or Corsham as the site where you would like to have your service provisioned, and we will try to accommodate requests and will advise you if we are unable do so. We control the deployed versions of technology on the platform. This covers internal platform-supporting technologies, and any technology versions available to you. Internally this includes, but isn't limited to, the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager and Oracle Virtual Machine Server versions, and the hardware version of the platform. Externally this includes the available versions of the Edge gateway and Oracle Enterprise Manager. You can make additional configurations inside an OVM (such as implementing third-party software technologies). We do not support customer implementations inside a VM. Operating systems UKCloud for Oracle Software includes the base OVM platform licences, which provide VM containers that meet Oracle's definition of hard partitioning. Our service does not include licences for the Oracle applications and databases you choose to run. As the underlying platform is powered by OVM technology, you can either transfer your existing licences, or purchase new licences based on the quantity of virtual processors (cores) you allocate within each VM. Please note that UKCloud does not have the functionality to provide Oracle licensing, and this must be sourced via an appropriate partner. 'Cores' refers to OVM vCPUs pinned to physical processor cores (excluding hyper-threading). Your Oracle licencing will be based on the cores consumed by your OVM. Update services. We make update repositories available for OVM containers. We don't provide software update facilities for non-UKCloud licensed software, including all Oracle applications. Anti-virus. We do not provide anti-virus software as part of the service. Networks Internet-facing solutions. You are provided with 2 usable public IP addresses, but you can ask for additional public IP addresses via a Service Request. We reserve the right to decline the request if you have spare capacity in your existing deployment. PSN-facing solutions. You should raise a Service Request or contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to be assigned your IP address. This solution also comes with contended bandwidth (uncapped). Janet and N3/HSCN solutions. You have one usable IP address, but you can request additional IP addresses via a Service Request. UKCloud for Oracle Software does not have a native external connectivity functionality. Therefore, UKCloud have enabled customers to manage connectivity rules, such as firewall, IPsec VPN and NAT functionality, through a VMware Edge gateway. This Edge is provisioned within the UKCloud for VMware Environment and is managed using either the UKCloud Portal GUI or API. This Edge can be an existing Edge in a customer's UKCloud for VMware environment, or can be provisioned as a completely new entity, specific for Oracle. Edge gateway (previously vShield Edge) By default, we assign one edge gateway per connectivity type. You can choose which external network you would like to enable your Oracle environment to connect to. Note that the Oracle environment does not have to connect to an external network, however an external network will need to be connected to the Edge. Site-to-site IPsec VPN. You can create IPsec VPN tunnels to connect different environments, both internal and external, to UKCloud. There is a limit of 64 tunnels per edge gateway. Bring Your Own Firewall Bring Your Own Firewall is currently not available for UKCloud for Oracle Software installations; however, you can have BYOF within UKCloud for VMware and connect it to the UKCloud for Oracle Software Edge gateway via an IPsec VPN. Protective monitoring We have implemented GPG 13-aligned Protective Monitoring across the Assured and Elevated platforms at the hypervisor level and below. We don't provide Protective Monitoring services above the hypervisor (for example, for your VM). Components above this infrastructure are your own responsibility to provide an appropriate protective monitoring capability. In line with UKCloud's System Interconnect and Security Policy (SISP), we provide notification of customer-impacting security incidents. It is your responsibility to report similar incidents to us. Platform management Users can access, manage and view the UKCloud for Oracle Software service, accessing only those features allowed by their role, in any of the following ways: Oracle Enterprise Manager. The graphical interface for the creation and management of the Oracle environment. vCloud Director API. Enables the programmatic creation and management of the Oracle Edge gateway. vCloud Director graphical UI. Provides a graphical interface to access the vCloud Director environment to manage the Oracle Edge gateway (depending on assigned permissions). UKCloud Portal. Enables the creation of Oracle Compute services and Edge gateways. The Portal also includes an overview of actual and estimated spend, along with service configuration information. Access to service reporting and incident and request management is also possible through the Portal. You cannot access the underlying infrastructure. This includes (but isn't limited to) the hardware and the Oracle Virtual Machine Manager environment. Service migration UKCloud do not currently provide migration services, however customers are free to bring their own migration tools and utilise them within the UKCloud for Oracle Software environment. Service reporting Visibility. We provide a monthly service report via the UKCloud Portal. This includes a summary of platform availability and a retrospective of the interactions with UKCloud support during the previous month. Maintenance notifications and Service Status reports are also delivered through the portal. Service reporting. All service reporting is done via the UKCloud Portal. Billing. Billing is issued on a monthly basis where you will be billed for your total monthly consumption. Customer service Customer Success Manager (CSM). For the first 90 days of the service, you have access to a UKCloud CSM who will help you with your adoption of the UKCloud UKCloud for Oracle Software service. This includes finding relevant systems and how to use UKCloud tools and processes. Cloud Architects. UKCloud Cloud Architects support you during the design of solutions for the cloud platform. UKCloud Cloud Architects are ideally placed to help reconcile your requirements with the UKCloud platform. We recommend engagement with a Cloud Architect when implementing Oracle solutions. Technical Account Managers (TAM). You will be allocated with an assigned point of contact who will provide ongoing assistance with reporting and incident escalation. Support. After the initial on-boarding and design phase, you can utilise the standard UKCloud support entitlement, which is documented in the Customer Care Factsheet in the Knowledge Centre ( Assured | Elevated ).

    "title": "How to change IPsec VPN settings via the vCloud API | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to change IPsec VPN settings via the vCloud Director API Overview This guide shows you how to retrieve, modify, and submit blocks of XML that represent the configuration of the IPsec VPN tunnels. The guide covers modifications to the local and peer IP addresses, local and peer IDs as well the addition or removal of local and peer subnets. In addition to this, the guide also outlines the steps required to modify the shared secret key used on a given IPsec VPN tunnel. Use cases: Enabling customers to quickly amend IPsec configurations Modifications of this nature are not possible in the vCloud Director graphical user interface without first deleting the existing IPsec VPN configuration entirely and re-entering the settings. Depending on the number of tunnels, this can be a lengthy task. Making changes to the IPsec VPN configuration via the vCloud API can greatly speed up this process. Edge gateway configuration data You can also use the steps in this guide to obtain a backup of the current configuration applied to an edge gateway. You can then use this to restore the configuration of the edge gateway at a later point in time. By following the instructions in this guide you can make amendments to the IPsec VPN configuration without first needing to engage with UKCloud Support. Before you begin Before using the vCloud API to view and update IPsec VPN settings, we recommend that you install a REST client that enables you to access the API. The steps in this article use a Firefox plugin called RESTClient. For information about how to install this plugin, see How to install a REST client to access the vCloud API . You also need to find your API credentials. For more information, see How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API Obtaining an authorisation token To start interacting with the vCloud API, you first need to obtain an x-vcloud-authorization token; to do this you need to adjust some settings in RESTClient. In your browser, click the RESTClient icon. From the Method menu, select POST . In the API field, enter the API URL you recorded earlier and append the following to the end of the URL: /api/sessions Next add a Basic Authentication header. To do this, from the Authentication menu at the top of the REST Client, select Basic Authentication . In the Basic Authentication dialog box, in the Username field, enter your API username recorded earlier from the API page. In the Password field enter your UKCloud Portal password and then click Okay . The Request section now includes an Authorization header. Next add an Accept header. To do this, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field, enter Accept In the Value field enter application/*+xml;version=5.5 and then click Okay . The Headers section should now be displayed, containing the Accept header. The RESTClient has now got all the required settings in place to make a request to the vCloud API to obtain a x-vcloud-authorization token, so click the Send button. When a response is received the Headers tab in the Response section will be populated, including an x-vcloud-authorization token. The x-vcloud-authorization token will replace the Basic Authentication header added earlier. To do this highlight and copy the string of characters displayed after the word x-vcloud-authorization . Note If at any point while following the instructions in this guide, the output displayed in the REST Client does not look similar to that shown in the images, you can use the value of the Status Code field to determine what went wrong and needs investigation. In this case above, Status Code received was HTTP 200 OK, which means that the request succeeded. For a list of HTTP response codes, see HTTP Response Codes . To add an x-vcloud-authorization header, from the Headers menu, select Custom Header . In the Request Header dialog box, in the Name field enter x-vcloud-authorization . In the Value field, paste the string of characters copied in the previous step, then click Okay . Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can remove the Basic Authentication Header. Click the x in the upper right-hand corner of the header. ## Retrieving organisation details via the API Retrieving organisation details via the API Now that you've obtained an x-vcloud-authorization token, you can call the vCloud API to retrieve the information that you need about your organisation to set up your IPsec VPN. Set the Method to GET . In the Response section, select the Preview tab. This view lists the links that you can use to drill down into the various objects exposed via the vCloud API. Of interest in the output below is a link that will, when queried, return details about the organisation and the objects contained within it. The link should look something like: https://<api_url>/api/org/<org_id> Copy the URL and paste it into the Request URL field. Click Send . After a short amount of time the contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated to reflect the response from the vCloud API to your latest request, including links to each VDC in the organisation. Retrieving virtual data centre details via the API To retrieve details about the VDCs in an organisation: Copy the link for the VDC containing the target edge gateway for your IPsec VPN. The link should look something like: https>//<api_url>/api/vdc/<vdc_id> Click Send . The contents of the Response Preview tab will be updated again. Retrieving edge gateway configuration via the API To retrieve details of the edge gateway configuration: The response this time will probably be quite long. To easily locate a specific section in the response, use your browser's search utility. You can invoke this in Firefox by pressing CTRL+F . In the search dialog window at the bottom of the screen enter edgeGateways , and then click the down arrow button to locate a section that looks similar to the one shown below: <Link rel=\"edgeGateways\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/vdc/<vdc_id>/edgeGateways\" type=\"application/vnd.vmware.vcloud.query.records+xml\" /> Copy the link ending in /edgeGateways and paste it into the URL field at the top of the RESTClient. Ensure that the Method drop down is set to GET and click Send . If this request is successful, the response will contain a link to the edge gateway which, when queried, will return the configuration of the edge gateway. Once you have received a response, use your browser's search utility to locate the EdgeGatewayRecord section within the response. <EdgeGatewayRecord gatewayStatus=\"READY\" haStatus=\"UP\" isBusy=\"false\" name=\"UKCloud Gateway (nft00002i2)\" numberOfExtNetworks=\"1\" numberOfOrgNetworks=\"8\" vdc=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/vdc/<vdc_id>\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/admin/edgeGateway/<edge_id>\" task=\"https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/task/<task_id>\" isSyslogServerSettingInSync=\"true\" taskOperation=\"networkConfigureEdgeGatewayServices\" taskStatus=\"success\" taskDetails=\" \" /> Within the EdgeGatewayRecord section of the above from the response, locate the link to the edge gateway that starts with the following: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/ Appended to the end of the URL will be a unique identifier for the edge gateway within the VDC. Copy this link, paste it into the URL field and then click Send . After a short amount of time the current configuration of the edge gateway will be displayed in a block of XML. Reviewing the edge gateway configuration The edge configuration information is contained between an opening <Configuration> and closing </Configuration> tag. This block of XML is split into sections which detail the configuration settings applied to a specific item, function or service available on the edge gateway. There are twelve sections in total; however only the configuration settings contained under the <GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags will be discussed in this guide. The example below shows a high‑level overview of the structure of the XML block returned, including the <GatewayIpsecVpnServices> tags. <EdgeGateway> <Configuration> <GatewayBackingConfig> </GatewayBackingConfig> <GatewayInterfaces> </GatewayInterfaces> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <FirewallService> </FirewallService> <NatService> </NatService> <GatewayIpsecVpnService> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> <StaticRoutingService> </StaticRoutingService> <LoadBalancerService> </LoadBalancerService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> <HaEnabled> </HaEnabled> <UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </UseDefaultRouteForDnsRelay> </Configuration> </EdgeGateway\\> Before making any changes to the edge gateway via the API it is highly recommended to keep a copy of the XML returned. You can then use this backup to restore the configuration of the edge gateway to a known working configuration if the need arises. To copy the XML: Select the Response Preview tab of the RESTClient. Scroll down to the opening <Configuration> tag and highlight everything up to and including the closing <\\Configuration> tag. The length of the XML to copy is dependent on the number of NAT, firewall rules and another configuration applied to the edge gateway. With the contents of the <Configuration> tags highlighted, right click and select Copy . Paste the configuration into a text editor, saving the file to a known location on your computer. Using a text editor that offers syntax highlighting such as Notepad++ will simplify the editing process. Locating the IPsec VPN settings in the returned XML To locate the IPsec VPN settings, open a new text editor window and copy and paste the contents between the opening <GatewayIpsecVpnService> and closing </GatewayIpsecVpnService> tags. The contents should look similar to the XML block shown below: <GatewayIpsecVpnService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <Endpoint> <Network type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.ukcloud.com/api/admin/network/3c284ec8-2850- ba77-098c-7f697a3d8769\"/> <PublicIp>37.26.88.73</PublicIp> </Endpoint> <Tunnel> <Name>UKCloud IPSEC VPN Demo</Name> <Description/> <IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> </IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerIpAddress>134.170.188.221</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> <LocalIpAddress>172.26.45.97</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>172.26.45.97</LocalId> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <SharedSecret>UKCloudIPSECVPNDemoSharedSecretKey</SharedSecret> <SharedSecretEncrypted>false</SharedSecretEncrypted> <EncryptionProtocol>AES256</EncryptionProtocol> <Mtu>1500</Mtu> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <IsOperational>true</IsOperational> </Tunnel> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> Modifying the IPsec VPN configuration This section outlines common tasks performed via the API to manipulate the IPsec VPN configuration applied to a given edge gateway. Modifying the local endpoint IP and local ID You can change the local IP and local ID by editing the contents between the opening <localIpAddress> and closing </localIpAddress> and <localId> and </localId> tags as shown below. Original <LocalIpAddress>172.26.45.97</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>172.26.45.97</LocalId> Modified <LocalIpAddress>37.26.88.73</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>37.26.88.73</LocalId> This is by far the most commonly performed modification to the IPsec VPN configuration via the vCloud API. You can use this to change the local IP address from the IP address assigned to the edge gateway on the transit network to the IP address assigned to the edge gateways on the public network. For the tunnel to come up successfully, the local IP address must be set to the edge gateway's public IP address. The local ID must also match the public IP address specified. Modifying the peer endpoint IP and peer ID If you need to move the remote endpoint of the tunnel to a new device or IP address, then you can adjust the following as required. Original <PeerIpAddress>134.170.188.221</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>134.170.188.221</PeerId> Modified <PeerIpAddress>212.58.244.18</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>212.58.244.18</PeerId> When changing the peer IP address of the tunnel you must ensure that the peer ID is also updated to match the new peer IP address. Adding or removing local subnets You can add additional local subnets to the IPsec VPN tunnel. This involves adding a new local subnet definition to the IPsec VPN config. Original <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> Modified <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 2</Name> <Gateway>192.168.3.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> Adding or removing peer subnets You can use the same process to add or remove peer subnets *Orginal <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> Modified <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.4.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.4.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> Amending the shared secret If you need to update or amend the shared secret on an IPsec VPN, edit the value between the opening <SharedSecret> and closing </SharedSecret> tags. Original <SharedSecret>UKCloudIPSECVPNDemoSharedSecretKey</SharedSecret> Modified <SharedSecret>4dae850771fbe3f06588b49772c0b8eb</SharedSecret> Note The shared secret must be at least 32 characters in length. To enhance the security of the tunnel, we highly recommend that you avoid using dictionary words in the shared secret key. Applying the new configuration When you've updated the relevant sections of the configuration, you can apply it to the edge gateway. Enclose the new configuration in a pair of <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration> tags, as shown in the following example. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration xmlns=\"http://www.vmware.com/vcloud/v1.5\"> <GatewayIpsecVpnService> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <Endpoint> <Network type=\"application/vnd.vmware.admin.network+xml\" href=\"https://api.vcd.portal.ukcloud.com/api/admin/network/3c284ec8-2850- ba77-098c-7f697a3d8769\\\"/\\> <PublicIp>37.26.88.73</PublicIp> </Endpoint\\> <Tunnel\\> <Name>ukcloud IPSEC VPN Demo</Name> <Description/> <IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerId>212.58.244.18</PeerId> </IpsecVpnThirdPartyPeer> <PeerIpAddress>212.58.244.18</PeerIpAddress> <PeerId>212.58.244.18</PeerId> <LocalIpAddress>37.26.88.73</LocalIpAddress> <LocalId>37.26.88.73</LocalId> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 1</Name> <Gateway>192.168.1.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet\\> <LocalSubnet> <Name>VPN Test Network 2</Name> <Gateway>192.168.3.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </LocalSubnet> <PeerSubnet\\> <Name>192.168.2.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.2.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <PeerSubnet> <Name>192.168.4.0/24</Name> <Gateway>192.168.4.254</Gateway> <Netmask>255.255.255.0</Netmask> </PeerSubnet> <SharedSecret>4dae850771fbe3f06588b49772c0b8eb</SharedSecret> <SharedSecretEncrypted>false</SharedSecretEncrypted> <EncryptionProtocol>AES256</EncryptionProtocol> <Mtu>1500</Mtu> <IsEnabled>true</IsEnabled> <IsOperational>true</IsOperational> </Tunnel> </GatewayIpsecVpnService> </EdgeGatewayServiceConfiguration\\>** Copy and paste this configuration into the Request Body section of the RESTClient. From the Method list, select POST . Append the following to the URL in the URL field: /action/configureServices For example, if the original contents of the URL were: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/48fbb9e-2e90-c055-aa46-86f18766f5b1 The updated URL would be: https://<api_url>/api/admin/edgeGateway/48fbb9e-2e90-c055-aa46-86f18766f5b1/action/configureServices You must also add one more Header to the RESTClient prior to submitting the new configuration. From the Headers menu at the top of the REST Client select Custom Header . In the Name field, enter Content-Type . In the Attribute Value field enter the following: application/vnd.vmware.admin.edgeGatewayServiceConfiguration+xml Click Okay . To submit the new configuration, click Send . The status of the edge gateway as viewed from vCloud Director will briefly show as Updating Configuration . Once this process has completed, right click the edge gateway and select Configure Services . In the Configure Services window select the VPN tab. You should see the new configuration settings. Verify the status of the IPsec VPN tunnel on your remote device to ensure that the tunnel has been established successfully.

    "keywords": "How to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API Overview To perform some tasks within your UKCloud for VMware environment, you may need to access vCloud Director through the vCloud API. This guide shows you how to access the vCloud API. Finding your vCloud API credentials Before using the vCloud API, you first need to find your API credentials. Log in to the UKCloud Portal. For more detailed instructions, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . Select your account. In the top right corner of the page, click your username and then select API . The API page provides a view of your personal credentials for accessing the vCloud API. In particular, the page provides the following information for each compute service: API URL --- Use this URL at the beginning of your calls to the vCloud API. Note This URL will be different depending on the region in which your compute service is located. API Username --- The user ID to use to authenticate yourself with the vCloud API. Note The compute service ID is appended to the end of the username. This is because you may have access to multiple compute services. Username --- The API username without the appended compute service ID. Org ID --- Use this to uniquely identify the compute service (or vOrg) when using the vCloud API. Password --- For authentication with the vCloud API. This password is the same as the one you use to log in to the UKCloud Portal. Make a note of the Org ID , the API URL and your API Username . Obtaining an authorisation token Now that you have your API credentials, you can start interacting with the vCloud API. First you need to obtain an x-vcloud-authorization token. Send the following request to the vCloud API: POST https://<vcloud_api_url>/api/sessions Authorization: Basic <encoded_credentials> Accept: application/*+xml; version=5.6 Parameter Description Example vcloud_api_url The URL you use to access the vCloud API that you noted in Finding your vCloud API credentials api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com encoded_credentials Your login credentials that you noted in Finding your vCloud API credentials in the format: <username>@<compute_service_id>:<password> These credentials must be supplied in a MIME Base64 encoding, as specified in RFC 1421 auser@mycompute:pA5#word For example: POST https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/sessions Authoriziation: Basic dXN1cjpwYXNzCg== Accept: application/*+xml; version=5.6 The vCloud API response includes your x-vcloud-authorization token, for example: x-vcloud-authorization: cn9uYmdugN8E2j96+5Lqrc3YBvFsEgDHXzyfJrJ/6bM=\\ Content-Type: application/vnd.vmware.vcloud.session+xml;version=5.6 You must send this token in a header with any subsequent requests to authenticate yourself with the vCloud API.

    "title": "How to access syslog data for your edge gateway | UKCloud Ltd | UKCloud Knowledge Centre",
    "keywords": "How to access syslog data for your edge gateway Overview Your edge gateway is globally configured to send syslog messages to a specific IP address ( 100.127.255.250 ). By configuring a new network or IP address within your virtual data centre (VDC) and deploying a collector with the syslog IP address, you can access your edge gateway syslog data. You can then use this data to check: Allowed and denied network traffic Load balancer statistics Load balancer health This guide explains the network configuration required to provision a syslog collector within your VDC to receive syslog information direct from your edge gateway. Collecting syslog data for a single edge gateway The simplest scenario is to gather syslog data from a single edge gateway into one collector. To do this you need to create a routable location for the syslog IP address, by either: Adding the syslog IP address to an existing network interface card (NIC) on a routed subnet Add the syslog IP address to a subnet on the routed network. For example, if your existing monitoring server has a NIC on eth0 (for example, 10.0.1.10 ), on routed Org VDC network 10.0.1.0/24 , you'd add the syslog IP address to eth0 . Add a route on the vCNS Edge that routes the syslog IP address via the subnet. For example, route 100.127.255.250 MASK 255.255.255.255 via 10.0.1.10 . Configure the software on your existing monitoring server to capture data from the IP address of the vCNS edge. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Configuring a new routed network Create a new routed network with the following details: Org Network Name: Customer defined Gateway: 100.127.255.249 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248 DNS: Customer defined Static IP Pool: 100.127.255.250 -- 100.127.255.254 You can find more detailed steps for creating a routed network in Creating routed Org VDC networks . Deploy a new syslog server connected to the new routed network with a static address of 100.127.255.250 and install and configure the syslog server's edge gateway. Note The steps to achieve this depend on your operating system and chosen syslog server. Collecting syslog data for multiple edge gateways If you have multiple edge gateways under a single NFT you can gather the data from all those edges into the same syslog collector. Set up a single syslog collector for one of your vCNS Edges as described in the previous section. Note We'll refer to this edge gateway as the syslog edge and all the other edge gateways as source edges . Confirm that you can see the local syslog traffic from the local syslog edge. Create a firewall rule on the syslog edge to allow syslog traffic from the source edges' TRANSIT IPs ( 172.26. x . x in Assured or 172.26. LOWER OCTET . x in Elevated) through to the syslog server IP. You can create individual rules using the following suggestions: SOURCE TRANSIT IP :Any to 100.127.255.250 on UDP Any:Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP NFT TRANSIT CIDR/SUBNET :Any to 100.127.255.250:514 on UDP On each of the source edges, create a static route to direct traffic to the syslog edge. Use the following settings: Applied On: nft_network Name: Syslog traffic (or any other name you prefer) Network: 100.127.255.248/29 Next Hop IP: The TRANSIT IP address of the syslog edge Syslog packets from each source edge will now be forwarded to the syslog edge, with the source of the syslog traffic being the TRANSIT IP of the source edge. Perform a packet capture on the syslog collector to confirm it's receiving packets from the source edges. Note You may have to enable or disable logging on firewall rules to trigger syslog traffic. When you've confirmed that your syslog collector is receiving the syslog data, configure your syslog server to capture packets from the new syslog source. Enabling logging After setting up your syslog collector, you need to make sure that your edge gateway sends network traffic to the log.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for VMware Overview If you're new to UKCloud, you'll probably have received this guide as part of your welcome email. It will help you to get started using UKCloud for VMware. The Getting Started Guide provides an overview of UKCloud for VMware and gives you basic information about how to log in and set up your environment. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have access to the UKCloud Portal and vCloud Director. To build compute services and virtual data centres (VDCs) you must be a vCloud Director administrator. Before you begin You should have received your UKCloud Portal login credentials from your Customer Success Manager (CSM). We recommend that you use the Mozilla Firefox ESR 32-bit browser as this is supported by both the UKCloud Portal and by the Web Console for the version of vCloud Director used by UKCloud for VMware. More information! Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud Platform Introductions to UKCloud for VMware We understand that each enterprise application has its own set of technical and service requirements that must be addressed on an individual basis. UKCloud for VMware is highly configurable, and gives you the flexibility to use different service levels, VM sizes, security domains, connectivity and data protection options. You can build completely tailored solutions by mixing and matching service options. The choice doesn't lock you to one service or size and you can always change it later. Services within UKCloud belong to an account, which in turn belongs to a company. A company can own multiple accounts. You can use accounts to create separate environments for different projects or, in the case of UKCloud partners, to create separate environments for different customers. Within an account you can have multiple UKCloud services, one of which could be UKCloud for VMware. You can have multiple instances of a service within an account. Logging in to the UKCloud Portal The first thing you need to do to get started with UKCloud for VMware is to log in to the UKCloud Portal. Go to the appropriate URL, depending on the security domain in which your service is located: Assured OFFICIAL: https://portal.ukcloud.com Elevated OFFICIAL: https://portal.ukcloud.gsi.gov.uk On the Log in page, enter your credentials and click Sign in . Tip If you have forgotten your password, click the Forgotten password? link to request a password reset. If this is the first time you've logged in, use the temporary password you were given by your Portal administrator or CSM. You'll be prompted to change this temporary password. If your Portal administrator has enabled memorable word authentication or Google Two Factor Authentication (2FA), you'll be prompted for the second step of your authentication process. For example, for memorable word authentication, you'll be prompted to enter three randomly‑selected letters from your memorable word. (If this is the first time you've logged in, you'll be prompted to create a memorable word.) For more information about the UKCloud Portal and all the functionality it provides, see the Getting Started Guide for UKCloud Portal . Creating your UKCloud for VMware estate When you first access UKCloud for VMware, you'll need to create a compute service (sometimes called a vOrg) to act as a top-level container for your cloud resources. As your estate grows, you can add more compute services to logically organise your resources. Within your compute service, you create VDCs to contain your VMs. VMs in the same VDC share workload characteristics and have access to the same resources, such as networking infrastructure, storage and external connectivity. We recommend that you organise related VMs within vApps to make your applications easier to manage. For example, you can start all the VMs within a vApp with a single operation, rather than having to start up each VM separately. vApps are also useful to help maintain crash‑consistency within an application in the event of a disaster. Building a compute service If you have the appropriate permissions, you can use the Portal to create a compute service in your account, without having to raise a support ticket. In the UKCloud Portal, select the account in which you want to create the compute service. In the navigation panel, expand Tools and then select Create Compute Service . On the Build Compute Service page, from the Zone radio buttons, select the zone in which you want to create the new compute service. Note In the Portal, you can create compute services only in zones in regions 5 and 6. Enter a Compute Service Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except +. Click Build . The Build Compute Service Status page displays information about the compute service you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VDCs in your compute service (see Building a virtual data centre ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Building a virtual data centre After creating your compute service, the next step is to create one or more VDCs. Note You can build VDCs in any of your compute services in regions 5 and 6, including those created by support tickets or the Portal API, not just those you created using the Portal. In the Portal navigation panel, expand VMware Cloud and then select the compute service in which you want to create the VDC. Note To create a VDC using the Portal, the compute service must be in region 5 or 6. From the Actions menu, select Build VDC . Note If this option is greyed out, either you do not have the appropriate permissions or your compute service is not in region 5 or 6. On the Build VDC page, from the VM Type radio buttons, select the option that describes the characteristics of the workload of the VDC: ESSENTIAL ---For lower priority workloads, such as temporary applications, data processing or system modelling tasks. VMs in the VDC can have contended compute resource allocation (CPU/RAM) and automated rebalancing is enabled to ensure the workload receives the requested performance. POWER ---For key workloads that are resource intensive, such as web and application workloads, mid-sized databases and caching services. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is enabled to pre-emptively optimise performance and availability. PRIORITY ---For critical workloads that handle important business processes that benefit from a steady state of operation. VMs in the VDC have an uncontended compute resource allocation and automated rebalancing is configured to reduce workload movement around the platform. Enter a VDC Name . Tip The name can be up to 32 characters long and can include any character except +. Click Build . The VDC Build Status page displays information about the VDC you're building and lets you know how the build is progressing. Tip You can stay on this page until the build is finished, or you can leave this page and check the status of the build later by going to the VMware Cloud Build History report. When the build is complete, the page displays either a success or fail message. If the build is successful, you can start building VMs. To provide external access to the VDC, you'll need to create an edge gateway (see How to build an edge gateway using the UKCloud Portal ). If the build is unsuccessful, raise a support ticket (quoting the Build ID ) to resolve any issues. Logging in to vCloud Director After you've created your compute service and VDC, you can start to build up your applications. To do this, you must log in to vCloud Director, which you can access from the UKCloud Portal. In the Portal navigation panel expand VMware Cloud then select your compute service. On the vCloud Director tab, for additional security, re-enter your UKCloud Portal password, then click Confirm . vCloud Director launches in your browser window. Note If this is the first time you've opened vCloud Director, you may be requested to download the vCloud Director Web Console plugin. Tip If you encounter any issues, make sure you're using the Firefox ESR 32-bit browser. For more information, see Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud Platform . The tasks you can perform in vCloud Director will depend on the permissions you have been granted. More information! Configuring permissions for vCloud Director To return to the UKCloud platform, click the Logout link in the top right corner of vCloud Director. Next steps In this Getting Started Guide , you've learned: About your UKCloud for VMware environment and how your estate is organised How to log in to the UKCloud Portal How to create a compute service and VDC to set up your environment How to log in to vCloud Director so that you can start to build your applications Now that you've set up your basic environment, you can start building your applications. If you want to get up and running quickly, you can take a look at Building virtual machines with Enterprise Compute Cloud , which provides a quick walkthrough of the process.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for Journaling Protection Overview Journaling Protection is a powerful, self-service replication and recovery tool that can help you improve your organisational resilience. By adopting UKCloud's Journaling Protection solution, you can protect your UKCloud for VMware applications by replicating them to another UKCloud for VMware‑enabled zone. This ensures that you can meet your disaster recovery requirements --- including any aggressive recovery point or recovery time objectives. Our Journaling Protection solution is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. This guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Journaling Protection up and running in your environment. Intended audience This guide is intended for any user who needs to create and manage Journaling Protection for UKCloud for VMware. To complete the steps in this guide you need to have access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal. Introduction to Journaling Protection You can protect your VMs by adding Journaling Protection to the vApp that contains those VMs. When you add Journaling Protection to a vApp, if a VM in that vApp is compromised, for example by a virus attack or bad software update, you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before that attack or update took place. You enable Journaling Protection by adding the vApp to a virtual protection group (VPG). Each VM in the protected vApp is synchronised to the recovery site and a journal is created. After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the source site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the recovery site and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for a specified number of days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to. For example, in the case of a virus, you could recover to a checkpoint from before the attack. During recovery, the vApp and its VMs are created on the recovery site and the recovery disks for each VM are attached to the recovered VM. Information in the journal is then promoted to the VM to bring it up to the date and time of the selected checkpoint. Two terms you may hear in connection with Journaling Protection are recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO). The RPO indicates the amount of data you can afford to lose in the event of an outage. For example, if your application data changes fairly infrequently, your RPO can be higher as the data remains fairly static. However, if your application data is constantly changing, you'll need your RPO to be smaller to avoid significant loss of data in the event of an outage. The RTO is the amount of time you can tolerate your application being unavailable in the event of an outage. For example, if your application provides critical functionality, you'll need to bring it back online very quickly. However, for a less critical application, you may be able to tolerate a longer outage. Because of the use of regular checkpoints (every few seconds), our Zerto‑powered Journaling Protection option provides a minimal RPO. The ability to use recovered VMs even before all the journal data has been promoted provides a good RTO as well. Before you begin When you request Journaling Protection for your VMs, UKCloud provides you with: A ZORG ID to identify your environment within Zerto Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP), where you can create and manage your VPGs You should consider the following: Journaling Protection is provided on a vApp basis (not for individual VMs). When designing your application, you should use vApps to group related VMs together to ensure crash consistency between VMs in the event of a failover. VMs must be powered on to be synchronised. The operating system used by the protected VMs must also be supported in the recovery site. Our Journaling Protection service option captures every action. When a VM is deleted from your vApp, the associated journal is also deleted. If you want to keep historic records of VMs that are no longer running on the platform, consider UKCloud's Snapshot Protection service option. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the Journaling Protection service scope . We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles. Getting Journaling Protection up and running To get Journaling Protection up and running for your VMs, follow the steps below: Create a recovery VDC Configure networking on the recovery site Create a virutal protection group Perform a test failover Create a recovery VDC To recover your VMs to a different UKCloud site, you must have a VDC in the intended recovery site. If you already have a compute service in the recovery site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see How to build your Enterprise Compute Cloud estate using the UKCloud Portal ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the recovery site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Journaling Protection Service Request. Configure networking on the recovery site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your recovery site to duplicate those in the source site. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ). In the event of a failover, external access to the recovery site will be via a different IP address. You'll need to account for any required DNS changes and external connectivity configuration (such as VPNs), to ensure continued external access. Utilising UKCloud's VMware cloud, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. You do not need to configure vApp networks in advance as they will be replicated within the VPG. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for protection purposes. The UKCloud Journaling Protection service option protects VMs on a vApp basis. When you create a VPG, you specify the vApp to protect and all the VMs in that vApp are protected. For example, in a standard three-tier application, you will likely have three VMs: one for your application, one for the database and one for the web server. As best practice, you should create these three related VMs in a single vApp, which you can then add to a VPG so that all the VMs are replicated (and recovered) together. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group . Perform a test failover After you create your VPG, we recommend that you perform a test failover to confirm that your VMs will be recovered correctly in the event of a live failover. You should also run test failovers periodically to ensure that your VMs can still be recovered successfully. For more information, see How to perform a failover . Next steps You have now performed all the steps needed to set up Journaling Protection for your VMs. If you experience a disaster, such as a virus attack, you can perform a live failover to recover your VMs to a specific point in time before the disaster occurred and continue operation as usual. For more information, see How to perform a failover .

This means that in the event of a VM being compromised, for example, a local hardware failure, power outage, security incident (such as theft) or WAN connectivity disruption, you can quickly recover your VMs to the UKCloud platform and ensure that the disruption to your service is minimised. Disaster Recovery as a Service is powered by Zerto, a leading provider of disaster recovery software for the cloud. This guide covers the tasks you need to perform to get Disaster Recovery as a Service up and running in your environment. Intended audience This guide is intended for any user who needs to set up Disaster Recovery as a Service. Introduction to Disaster Recovery as a Service If you provide services from your own data centre or on-site servers, Disaster Recovery as a Service can help you achieve a robust and flexible replication and recovery service, with the UKCloud platform as the recovery site. When you have set up Disaster Recovery as a Service for your VMs, every write operation to the protected VMs is copied and stored in a journal on the recovery site. This means that in the event of a VM being compromised, you can quickly recover the VM to a point in time before the disaster took place. You add disaster recovery protection to your VMs by adding them to a virtual protection group (VPG).

After this initial synchronisation, each subsequent write operation to the VM is processed as normal on the original site and a copy is asynchronously sent to the UKCloud site and written to the journal. Each journal entry exists in the journal for 14 days (the journal history). When the journal history is reached, as new journal entries are created, older entries are written to the recovery VM's virtual disks. Every few seconds, a checkpoint is written to every journal for each VM in the VPG to ensure crash-consistency between the VMs. If you need to recover a VM, you select a checkpoint to recover to.

The ability to use recovered VMs even before all the journal data has been promoted provides a good RTO as well. Before you begin When you order Disaster Recovery as a Service, UKCloud provides you with: The IP address (from the IP range you provided to UKCloud) of the Zerto Cloud Connector (ZCC) deployed in your recovery VDC; you'll need this to complete the setup of the site-to-site VPN between your local environment and your recovery VDC A link to the appropriate version of the Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) for you to deploy in your local environment A ZORG ID to identify your Zerto environment within the UKCloud platform Access to the Zerto Self-Service Portal (ZSSP) in the appropriate UKCloud zone, where you can trigger a failover You should consider the following: VMs must be powered on to be synchronised. The operating system used by the protected VMs must also be supported in the recovery site. Disaster Recovery as a Service captures every action. When a VM is deleted, the associated journal is also deleted. We provide a single default service profile. The details of this are available in the Disaster Recovery as a Service Service Scope. We do not currently provide the option for you to create custom profiles. System requirements To use Disaster Recovery as a Service, you must have a valid, centrally managed vSphere or HyperV estate. A single hypervisor is not sufficient. The following table lists the minimum requirements for Disaster Recovery as a Service, based on the currently deployed version of Zerto Virtual Replication (4.5U4) on the UKCloud platform: Product Supported Version Management Plane VMWare vCenter 4.0U1 -- 6.0U2 Microsoft SCVMM 2012 R2 and Server Core: Update Rollup 6-11 (recommended) 2012 R2 and Server Core: RTM Hosts VMWare ESX/ESXi 4.0U1-4.0U3, 4.0U4 , 4.1-6.0U1, 6.0U2 Microsoft Hyper-V 2012 R2 and Server Core Virtual Machines Hardware Version VMWare Up to Version 10 Hyper-V Generation 1&2 Disaster Recovery as a Service Connectivity Full Duplex Internet connection 5Mb/s minimum IPSEC VPN NA For a complete list of hypervisor features supported when using Disaster Recovery as a Service, see: http://s3.amazonaws.com/zertodownload_docs/4.5U4/Zerto%20Virtual%20Replication%20Operability%20Matrix.pdf Getting Disaster Recovery as a Service up and running To get Disaster Recovery as a Service up and running in your environment, follow the steps below: Create a recovery VDC Set up your local environment Configure networking on the recovery site Create a virtual protection group Perform a test failover Create a recovery VDC To recover your VMs to the UKCloud platform, you must have a VDC in the intended recovery site. If you already have a compute service in the UKCloud site, you can use an existing VDC or you can create a new one using: The UKCloud Portal (for more information see How to build your Enterprise Compute Cloud estate using the UKCloud Portal ) The UKCloud Portal API (for more information see the How to use the UKCloud Portal API ) If you don't already have a compute service in the UKCloud site or you'd prefer UKCloud to create the VDC for you, you can request this as part of your Disaster Recovery as a Service Service Request. Set up your local environment Before you can start using Disaster Recovery as a Service, you need to prepare your local environment by: Installing the appropriate version of Zerto Virtual Manager (ZVM) in your local environment Creating a secure site-to-site VPN between your local environment and the UKCloud platform For more information, see How to install and configure Zerto in your local environment . Configure networking on the recovery site You must configure any internally and externally routed networks in your UKCloud recovery VDC to duplicate those in your local environment. You must also configure the edge gateway with the same firewall, NAT and other rules. You'll create the mapping between these networks when you create your VPG (see How to create a virtual protection group ).

Utilising UKCloud's enterprise compute platform, you can configure this in advance. Alternatively, you can use load balancing technologies to manage a seamless switch between environments. Create a virtual protection group A virtual protection group (VPG) is a collection of VMs that are grouped together for disaster recovery purposes. When you create a VPG, a replica of each VM disk is created on the recovery site. These replica virtual disks are then populated with the data in the protected VMs by synchronising the protected VMs with the recovery site replicas. For more information, see How to create a virtual protection group .

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for the UKCloud Portal Overview The UKCloud Portal is the gateway to your UKCloud services. In the Portal, you can: View information about your UKCloud services, including UKCloud for VMware, UKCloud for OpenStack and Cloud Storage View notifications relating to the UKCloud platform Create compute services, virtual data centres (VDCs) and edge gateways within your UKCloud for VMware environment Access vCloud Director to work with your UKCloud for VMware environment, for example to create and manage virtual machines (VMs), build VDC networks or configure your firewall Raise and monitor support tickets Access Knowledge Centre articles to help you understand and work with the UKCloud platform This Getting Started Guide provides an overview of the functionality available within the Portal. Intended audience This Getting Started Guide is intended for any user with access to the Portal. Note The options you can see and tasks you can perform within the Portal depend on the permissions you've been granted by your Portal administrator. Before you begin You should have received your Portal login credentials from your Portal administrator. If you're the Portal administrator, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will have provided you with your login credentials. The Portal works with Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. However, if you'll be using vCloud Director, we recommend that you use the Firefox ESR browser as this is also supported by the Web Console for the version of vCloud Director used by UKCloud for VMware. More information! Browser requirements for services on the UKCloud platform Logging in to the UKCloud Portal The first thing you need to do is log in. Go to the appropriate URL, depending on the security domain in which your service is located: Assured OFFICIAL: https://portal.ukcloud.com Elevated OFFICIAL: https://portal.ukcloud.gsi.gov.uk On the Log in page, enter your credentials and click Sign in . If this is the first time you've logged in, use the temporary password you were given by your Portal administrator or CSM. You'll be prompted to change this temporary password. Tip If you've forgotten your password, click the Forgotten password? link to request a password reset. If your Portal administrator has enabled memorable word authentication or Google Two Factor Authentication (2FA), you'll be prompted for the second step of the authentication process. For example, for memorable word authentication, you'll be prompted to enter three randomly‑selected letters from your memorable word. (If this is the first time you've logged in, you'll be prompted to create a memorable word.) Note If you incorrectly enter your password three times, you'll be prompted to enter a captcha code until you successfully log in. If you incorrectly enter the captcha code or your password another three times, a seventh unsuccessful login attempt will result in your account being locked. You'll need to contact your Portal administrator to unlock your account. Getting to know the UKCloud Portal After you log in, you'll see the Portal Home page. A Portal page is made up of three main areas: Toolbar Navigation panel Content area Toolbar Each user account is associated with one or more customer accounts. Within the Portal, you can work within any customer account to which you have access. From the toolbar, you can switch between different customer accounts. Note When you switch between accounts, you may be prompted to enter letters from your memorable word again if this additional security measure has been enabled by your Portal administrator. In the toolbar, you can also click your username to access the following options: Notifications --- List all Portal notifications. Unread notifications are displayed in bold. Click the View button next to a notification to see more details. When you've finished reading a notification, select the Notifications tab to return to the list.

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for OpenStack Overview If you're new to UKCloud, you'll probably have received this guide as part of your welcome email. This Getting Started Guide covers basic topics like where to find your instances (virtual machines, or VMs, in VMware terminology), as well as more in-depth topics such as instance storage choice (ephemeral or volume storage) and its implications. Intended audience This guide is intended for users who want to learn more about UKCloud for OpenStack. Logging in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard The first thing you need to do is to log in to the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. Go to the URL provided in your welcome email. The examples in this guide use https://cor00005.cni.ukcloud.com/ . Enter your login credentials and click Connect . After logging in, the first screen you'll see is the Overview page. From here you can get an immediate summary of your project and show your resource usage against the quotas on the project. Creating your network infrastructure Before you can begin creating instances, you must first build out the underlying network infrastructure. In a freshly provisioned project, the only resource that will exist initially is a shared external network called internet . You need to create the following minimum set of resources: A router using the internet external network A network and associated subnet, specifying the network address using CIDR notation (for example, 192.168.1.0/24), and DHCP settings for DNS, static routes, and so on. A router interface to connect the router to your new subnet When you have created these elements, you can view them in the Network Topology page in the Horizon dashboard. You can create your network infrastructure in one of the following ways: Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure (see Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure ) Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks (see Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks ) Using the OpenStack API and automation (see [Using the OpenStack API and automation](#using the-openstack-api-and-automation)) Using Horizon to manually create your infrastructure The Network Topology page is a useful page to get started with. This page provides a resizable, moveable and interactive view of your OpenStack project, along with easily accessible buttons for manually creating routers and networks and for launching instances. To create your network infrastructure: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Network menu on the left side of the screen and select Network Topology . On the Network Topology page, click the Create Router button. In the Create Router dialog box, enter a Router Name . From the Admin State list, ensure that UP is selected so that the router is online at the point of creation. From the External Network list, select the external network to which you want to attach your router. Click Create Router . Back on the Network Topology page, click the Create Network button. On the Network page of the Create Network wizard, enter a Network Name and click Next . On the Subnet page, enter a Subnet Name . In the Network Address field, allocate your network a suitable address space. In the Gateway IP field, enter an IP address from the address space for the router you created earlier to use to access the network. Click Next . On the Subnet Details page, the only field you'll probably want to change is DNS Name Servers . UKCloud does not provide DNS as a service, so to start with you could make use of Google's public 8.8.8.8 service. You can update this field later if you intend to run your own DNS caching service. If you leave the Allocation Pools field blank, then by default the whole address space is used for the pool. Click Create . To add the router interface to link your new network to the router, on the Network Topology page, select the router and click the Add Interface button. In the Add Interface dialog box, from the Subnet list, select your subnet and then click Add Interface . Understanding access and security Security groups In OpenStack, rather than deploying a perimeter firewall to protect your network from the outside world, every instance is protected by its own firewall. This instance firewall is applied at the network level, independent of any additional firewall the guest operating system may be using. The instance firewall is controlled by applying one or more security groups to the instance, either at instance creation or real-time at any point during the lifecycle of the instance. Where multiple security groups are specified, the firewall rules are the result of compounding all the rules together. A security group consists of one or more rules. Each rule is composed of five elements: Role --- Custom or predefined protocol type (for example, TCP, UDP or ICMP) Direction --- Ingress or Egress Open Port or Port Range --- Open either a single port or a range of ports Remote --- The source of the traffic to be allowed via this rule (source address for an inbound rule, or destination address for an outbound rule) The ether type (that is IPv4 or IPv6) --- Not currently available When adding a new rule to a security group, you can choose from a pre-populated list of common rules, for example, SSH, DNS, HTTP or SMTP, or you can specify your own custom rule. SSH key pairs Another change if you're used to using vCloud Director, is the authenticated access to your instances. OpenStack, like most other cloud providers, doesn't use templates that allow password controlled access. The standard cloud method of authenticating access to a new instance is to use SSH key pair authentication --- your SSH client uses the private key and OpenStack injects the public key into your new instance using the cloud-init package pre-installed in the instance image. Before you launch any instances on OpenStack, you need to set up at least one SSH key pair. You can use OpenStack to create a new key pair for you, or if you have an existing SSH key pair, you can import the public key so that OpenStack can use it to inject into new instances. To see what public keys have already been set up for your use: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . Select the Key Pairs tab. If you want OpenStack to create a key pair for you: Click the Create Key Pair button. In the Create Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and then click Create Key Pair . OpenStack creates the key pair and downloads it in your web browser. Save the file somewhere safe as you will need it when connecting your SSH client to your instances. To import an existing public key: On the Key Pairs tab of the Access & Security page, click the Import Key Pair button. In the Import Key Pair dialog box, enter a Key Pair Name and paste the contents of your existing public key file into the Public Key field. Click Import Key Pair . Note for Windows users If you're using a Windows desktop environment, the chances are that you're using the PuTTY program for your SSH client. The PuTTY SSH client doesn't use OpenSSH format files for the key pair files. It does however provide a PuTTYgen program that can import and export in the correct format as outlined below. If you want OpenStack to create your key pair: Open PuTTYgen. From the Conversions menu select Import key . Select the downloaded private key file generated by OpenStack. Click the Save private key button to save the imported key as a ppk file that PuTTY can use for authentication. If you want to import an existing key: Open PuTTYgen. Click the Generate button. Copy the public key from the top of the dialog box. Paste the public key into the Public Key field in Horizon's Import Key Pair dialog box. Launching your instances Now that you've considered security, created a network and a subnet, and you've connected them to your external network with a router, you can start to think about launching some instances attached to the network. There are a few choices you need to make when launching your instances. The following sections outline how to achieve this task via the Horizon dashboard, however you can also use HEAT templates or the OpenStack API. Choosing your image When you create an instance in OpenStack, its disk is cloned from an image managed by OpenStack. The image may be a custom image that has been developed for a specific purpose and uploaded to your project. It may also be a custom image that has been specifically shared between two projects. More likely, you'll start by using one of the public images that we provide and manage on our platform. You can see the images that are available for you to use by expanding the Compute menu on the left side of the Horizon dashboard and clicking Images . Choosing your instance size If you're already familiar with UKCloud's vCloud Director-based Enterprise Compute Cloud service, then you may be used to being able to choose exactly how many vCPUs and how much memory a VM is allocated. In OpenStack, you choices are restricted to a number of pre-defined flavors that define how many vCPUs, how much memory and how much storage an instance may use. Although full details for each flavor are available through the Horizon UI, there's no overall list available showing all the different flavors and sizes of instances. However, if you've installed the OpenStack CLI tools (see http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html ), you can run the following command to retrieve a list of the flavors and their makeup \\> openstack flavor list Choosing your storage type There are two storage options available for use with your instances: Ephemeral storage (default) Persistent volume storage Ephemeral storage When you create an instance, the default behaviour is to clone your chosen disk image onto the physical disk attached to the host that will be running the instance. This is not dedicated locally attached storage to your instance, but rather a RAID array of fast SSD disks that is shared by all the instances running on the host hypervisor. The performance of the ephemeral storage makes for very fast disk access. However, as the disk image is stored locally on the host hypervisor, you're at risk of data loss in the event of hardware failure on the host. For scheduled maintenance on the host, you can live‑migrate instances onto other hosts with minimal interruption. If the host were to suffer a hardware failure, it's likely that you'd lose the data stored on the disk image, so you should architect your application to expect and be able to recover from failure. Persistent volume storage As an alternative to ephemeral storage you can clone your chosen disk image to an OpenStack volume , which is a persistent storage option backed by a Ceph storage array. The volume is then network mounted onto the host hypervisor and the instance booted from the network attached storage. For scheduled maintenance on the host, these instances are more easily managed onto other hosts. In the event of a hardware failure on the host, the volume can just be mounted to another host and the instance restarted without any data loss. For more information about volumes, see Working with volumes . Creating an instance You can create a new instance in the Horizon UI. Click or select Launch Instance on one of the following pages: Images page (under the Compute menu) Instances page (under the Compute menu) Network Topology page (under the Networks menu) On the Details tab of the Launch Instance dialog box, enter an Instance Name and select a Flavor . As you select a flavor from the list, the dialog box updates to reflect the VCPUs , Disk and RAM that the selected flavour gives you and the green bars under Project Limits update to show what your usage would be after launching the instance. If you select a flavour that would take you over your project's quota, the bar is red rather than green. From the Instance Boot Source list, select: Boot from image to create an instance that boots from the local ephemeral storage. Boot from image (creates a new volume) to create an instance that boots from a volume From the Image Name list, select your preferred image. If you're creating an image that boots from a volume, you can choose what size to create the boot disk without being restricted to the disk allocation specified by the selected flavour. On the Access & Security tab, from the Key Pair list, select the SSH key pair you want to inject into your new instance. If there is only one SSH key pair configured in your project, it will be automatically selected. Select one or more Security Groups to apply to the instance. On the Networking tab, from the Available networks list, select the network that you want to create the new instance on. If your project has only a single network defined, that network will already be listed under Selected networks . Click Launch and OpenStack reports that your new instance is launching. Accessing your instance Having successfully launched your new instance, you'll want to log in and start installing your applications. To access your new instance from the outside world, you have to associate a floating IP address to the instance. A floating IP address is a public routable address that is allocated to your project. Having allocated an address to your project, you can then choose to associate it to a particular instance. When you've done this, a DNAT rule is automatically created on the router you created earlier to forward all incoming traffic to your chosen instance. To associate a floating IP address to your new instance: On the Instances page, from the Actions list for your instance, select Associate Floating IP . In the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, from the IP Address list, select the floating IP address that you want to allocate to the instance. If you don't have any spare floating IP addresses allocated to your project, you can click the + button next to the IP Address list to allocate a new address. In the Allocate Floating IP dialog box, from the Pool list, select the pool from which to allocate the floating IP address. Currently the only option is internet , but the list will expand as additional networks come online. Click Allocate IP to allocate the new floating IP address to your project. Back in the Manage Floating IP Associations dialog box, associate the new address with your instance. Click Allocate IP . You can use your SSH client to connect to the floating IP address, authenticating the connection with the private key that matches the key pair you selected when you launched the instance. You can find more information about using and controlling instances and images on OpenStack in the Red Hat documentation at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/instances-and-images-guide/instances-and-images-guide . Working with volumes Creating a volume Volumes are block devices that you can attach to instances. Because volumes are replicated across OpenStack's storage array, effectively providing three copies of data from a resilience perspective, they provide the basis of our persistent storage offering. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, click the Create Volume button. In the Create Volume dialog box, enter a Volume Name and Description . From the Volume Source list, select: No source, empty volume to create a totally empty volume for customer to populate with their data (this is the default option) Image to enable customer to create a prepopulated volume from a previously created image From the Volume Type list, select: Tier 1 for our most performant block storage for workloads requiring consistently higher disk throughput Tier 2 for block storage with typical performance characteristics for use by production applications or storage (this is the default option) From the Size list, select the size of your volume in GiB. From the Availability Zone list, select the availability zone to which you want to target your volume. Create Create Volume . Retyping a volume You can retype a volume to take an existing volume of a particular volume type and converting it to another (that is, from Tier 1 to Tier 2 or vice versa). Retyping a volume attached to an instance Due to a dependency on the underlying hypervisor, it is not currently possible to retype a volume that is attached to an instance. If you want to retype a volume that is attached to an instance, you must first detach the volume from the instance. To detach the volume from the instance, in the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to detach, from the list on the far right of the page, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, click the Detach Volume button. Retype the volume by following the steps in Retyping an independent volume . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to reattach, from the list on the far right, select Manage Attachments . In the Manage Volume Attachments dialog box, from the Attach to Instance list, select the instance to which you want to reattach the volume and click the Attach Volume button. Note If you attempt to retype a volume that is still attached to an instance, the process will attempt to run but will fail without notification. Retyping an independent volume If the volume that you want to retype is not attached to an instance, you can retype it. Ensure that the volume is detached from any instances. For information about how to detach an volume from an instance, see Retyping a volume attached to an instance . In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Volumes . On the Volumes page, for the volume that you want to retype, from the list on the far right of the page, select Change Volume Type . In the Change Volume Type dialog box, from the Type drop down list, select the new type for the volume. From the Migration Policy list, ensure that you select On Demand . Note If any other option is selected, the retyping process will not work. Click Change Volume Type . Note You may notice duplicate volumes while the retyping process is running. These duplicate volumes will disappear when the process has completed. Important Do not attach a retyped volume to an instance until the retyping process has completed successfully. Retyping an independent volume using the OpenStack CLI To retype a volume using the OpenStack CLI, use the following command: \\> cinder retype *volume* *volume-type* Where: volume is the name or ID of the volume that you want to retype volume-type is the new volume type Working with the API and automation Using the OpenStack Heat orchestration tool to create stacks OpenStack provides an orchestration tool out of the box. The Heat tool enables you to describe your infrastructure as a text file, referred to as a Heat template , defining one or more resources using a YAML format. Having defined your resources in your Heat template, you then use the template to create a stack . The stack contains the instantiation of the resources defined in the YAML file, along with a history of events and operations that have happened to the resources in the stack. For an example of what a basic Heat template looks like, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/blob/master/heat/example.yaml The example.yaml template creates the same router, network, subnet and router interface that you created manually above. In addition, the template defines an SSH key pair, security groups and launch instances. We'll look at these other resource elements in more detail later. To use a template to create a stack in your project: In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Orchestration menu on the left side of the screen and select Stacks . On the Stacks page, click the Launch Stack button. On the Select Template page, from the Template Source list, select URL . In the Template URL field, enter the URL of the Raw version of the template that you want to use (for example, the example.yaml template). Click Next . On the Launch Stack page, enter a Stack Name and select the flavour and image as required. Click Launch to start creating the stack resources in the background. You can go back to the Stacks page to view progress, drill down into the resources defined in the stack and see the events as they happen. You can also use an updated Heat template to apply an update to resources in a stack. You can also destroy an entire stack, cleaning up all the resources that you previously created. This makes Heat a very powerful tool for creating short‑lived test and preproduction environments on‑demand that may form part of a continuous delivery pipeline. Using the OpenStack API and automation OpenStack also provides a fully functional API to enable programmatic control over your project. The Horizon UI you used earlier is itself a client that makes calls to this underlying API. Although you can write your own code to interact with the API, there are a number of different libraries already available covering most popular programming languages. Alternatively, there is also a growing number of DevOps automation tools available (for example, Terraform and Ansible) that interact with the OpenStack API to orchestrate the creation and ongoing management of your infrastructure. For an example Terraform configuration to create a similar network infrastructure to the one you created in the previous examples, take a look at https://github.com/UKCloud/automation_examples/tree/master/terraform-os . Whatever library or automation tools you choose to use, you'll need to know a few important details to make a connection to and authenticate against the API. In the Horizon dashboard, expand the Compute menu on the left side of the screen and select Access & Security . On the Access and Security page, select the API Access tab. On the API Access tab, you can see all the relevant API endpoints for making connections to the various OpenStack subsystems, including the Identify endpoint, which provides the initial authentication process, that you'll typically need when configuring connections. You can also download your user's OpenStack RC file for use in the following section. Using the OpenStack command-line client The OpenStack project provides a command‑line client that enables you to access the project API through easy‑to‑use commands. For example, the Compute service provides a NOVA command‑line client. You can run the commands from the command line, or include the commands in scripts to automate tasks. If you provide OpenStack credentials, such as your user name and password, you can run these commands on any computer. The following file is a bash shell script format file that sets up all the relevant environment variables in the Linux shell session so that you can use the OpenStack CLI tools. The OpenStack CLI tools, just like the Horizon UI, also communicate with the OpenStack API. This means you can examine the contents of the RC file to find the settings that you may need to pass into, for example, a Terraform provider definition when configuring it to manage your OpenStack project. The key values to note here are the OS\\_AUTH\\_URL , OS\\_TENANT\\_NAME and OS\\_USERNAME environment variables, as these will be common to any API authentication request. In addition, creating the line export OS\\_INTERFACE=public in the RC file should address any issues you may have accessing the Admin API endpoints. Next steps In this Getting Started Guide, you've learned how to use the OpenStack Horizon UI to set up UKCloud for OpenStack and create new instances. You've also learned about the other tools available including the OpenStack API and command-line client.

This helps you to: Design using Computer Aided Design applications in a centralised environment, enabling ease of collaboration Create and run simulations Render and analyse high resolution images and video Before you begin When using our Cloud GPU service for visualisation workloads, you should consider the following: Before requesting your Cloud GPU Visualisation service: You must create a virtual machine (VM) for the service. You can use any template for the VM, but bear in mind that the operating system must be compatible with the vGPU profile that you select for the service (see table in Provisioning your Cloud GPU service ). Your Cloud GPU VM must be in a PRIORITY virtual data centre (VDC). Your Cloud GPU VM should be using hardware version 11 (to upgrade the hardware version, right-click the VM and select Upgrade Virtual Hardware Version ). You must power off the vApp that contains your Cloud GPU VM so that UKCloud can migrate the VM to a GPU-enabled server. Snapshot Protection is not available for your VM, so you must implement your own backup solution. Currently, there is no high availability or disaster recovery option; your VM cannot be migrated to a different host in the event of host failure. In the event of a host failure, you must wait for the host to be returned to service. Provisioning your Cloud GPU service When your VM is ready, make sure it is powered off and then use My Calls in the UKCloud Portal to raise a service request for the Cloud GPU service. Provide the following details in the ticket so that UKCloud can complete the setup of your service: Service type: GPU -- Visualisation VDC name vApp name VM name vGPU profile that you want to use (see table below) vGPU profile Intended use case Frame buffer (Mbytes) Virtual display heads Maximum resolution per display head Effective number of vGPUs M60-8Q* Designer 8192 4 4096x2160 8 M60-4Q* Designer 4096 4 4096x2160 4 M60-2Q* Designer 2048 4 4096x2160 2 M60-1Q* Power User, Designer 1024 2 4096x2160 1 M60-8A Virtual Application User 8192 1 1280x1024 8 M60-4A Virtual Application User 4096 1 1280x1024 4 M60-2A Virtual Application User 2048 1 1280x1024 2 M60-1A Virtual Application User 1024 1 1280x1024 1 * M60-Q profiles are for 64-bit Linux UKCloud will confirm that you've set up your VM correctly and that it meets all the necessary prerequisites. If the VM meets all requirements, UKCloud will migrate the VM to a GPU‑enabled host and attach the GPU card to your VM.

This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the public sector: from PSN Protected to N3/HSCN and RLI. This article provides an introduction to UKCloud for Microsoft Azure and helps you get up and running. Supported features UKCloud for Microsoft Azure supports the following Azure Stack IaaS features: Compute Virtual machines (VMs) provide the basic building block providing compute in Azure Stack. For a list of available VM sizes, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-sizes . You can deploy VMs using the Azure Stack portal and other tooling. VMs have the following support: API Azure Stack Marketplace - Provides access to pre-created images that help speed up application delivery Azure Resource Manager - Enables you to write templates to deploy, update and delete Azure Stack resources in a single co-ordinated operation https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-vm-considerations Network Virtual networks - Azure Stack enables you to configure virtual private clouds, create and manage your private address space within Azure; you can configure this via the UI, API and other tooling Load balancers (IPv4 only) — You can deploy basic load balancers VPN gateway — You can use the Azure Stack VPN gateway to create site-to-site VPNs to remote infrastructure Routing — You can configure basic custom defined routing on virtual networks; Vnet to Vnet peering is not yet supported https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-network-differences Storage Type of storage Description Notes vs Azure Azure Blob Storage (block) Object storage; good for storing documents, videos, images and so on Size of disk storage differs significantly, as well as naming standards like name length Azure Blob Storage (page) Used to support virtual machine disks; good for randomly accessed large files Azure Blob Storage (append) Used for log files Azure Queue Storage Message queue as a service to provide asynchronous scale out micro-services, among other things Azure Table Storage NoSQL database service; good for highly scalable, eventually consistent database support Max sizes differ Advanced features Key Vault — Azure Stack provides cryptographic secret storage for applications and services. These services can be consumed by both portal and API. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kv-intro Design considerations When designing your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure applications, consider the following: Compute Azure Stack supports a subset of Azure VM extensions; UKCloud for Microsoft Azure currently supports the following: BGInfo v2.1 CustomScriptExtension v1.8 JsonADDomainExtension v1.3 VMAccessAgent v2 CustomScriptForLinux v1.5.2.0 OSPatchingForLinux v2.3.0.1 VMAccessForLinux v1.4.0.0 DockerExtension v1.1.1606092330 DSC v2.19.0.0 IaaSAntimalware v1.4.0.0 IaaSDiagnostics v1.10.1.1 MicrosoftMonitoringAgent v1.0.10900.0 For an up-to-date list of the supported extensions, perform the following steps: First, ensure that you've installed the relevant Azure PowerShell tools from the following links: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-powershell-install https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-powershell-download Then run the following commands: Add-AzureRMEnvironment -Name \"AzureStackAdmin\" -ArmEndpoint \"https://management.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com\" Login-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName \"AzureStackAdmin\" Get-AzureRmVmImagePublisher -Location frn00006 | ` Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImageType | ` Get-AzureRmVMExtensionImage | ` Select Type, Version | ` Format-Table -Property * -AutoSize Use load balancers to make the best use of IP address quota Azure Stack API may be a couple of releases behind Azure Single region and single state set (affects availability) VM sets don't support auto-scale, so consider how to handle load Check Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to see if they're compatible with Azure Stack Storage Azure Stack storage is all served from the same pool of disks and does not provide “limitless” storage, so you should consider the following: Use blob storage (object storage) to support the application; not for multiple petabytes of data storage Put large volume data on UKCloud's Cloud Storage Clean up backups to conserve storage Consider use of temporary storage There is a difference in maximum blob storage between Azure and Azure Stack No guarantees around IOPs Use blob storage for queues to help deliver scalable micro-services Accessing UKCloud for Microsoft Azure You can access UKCloud for Microsoft Azure from the following location: https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/ Further information For more information about Azure Stack, see the following Microsoft resources: Get Started with Azure Azure Stack Operator Documentation For more information about UKCloud for Microsoft Azure, see: Getting Started Guide for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure UKCloud for Microsoft Azure FAQs Feedback If you have any comments on this article, or any other aspect of your UKCloud experience, send them to products@ukcloud.com ."

For example, you can use API calls to manage your UKCloud for Microsoft Azure tenancy. This guide shows you how to get started with the Azure Stack API. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have the appropriate permissions on the resource you are trying to access. Authenticating to the API Azure Stack API authentication uses access tokens to validate requests. To obtain an access token: Send a POST request to the Azure REST authentication/login endpoint: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant_id>/oauth2/token where tenant_id is one of: Your tenant domain, for example, ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com , ukcloud.com , example.mydomain.com Your tenant ID, for example 8eaef023-2b34-4da1-9baa-8bc8c9d6a490 The default value for tenant independent keys: common Pass the following parameters in the request body: grant_type - The type of authentication scheme to use: password client_id - Hard-coded to a default value of 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 Other options for specific scenarios are: LegacyPowerShell - 0a7bdc5c-7b57-40be-9939-d4c5fc7cd417* PowerShell - 1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 WindowsAzureActiveDirectory - 00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000 VisualStudio - 872cd9fa-d31f-45e0-9eab-6e460a02d1f1 AzureCLI - 04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46 resource - The endpoint of the resource the token will be used to access, for example, https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/4de154de-a8a8-4017-af41-df619da68154 You can obtain the resource endpoint by querying the Azure Stack management metadata endpoint. The resource endpoint is returned in the audiences section of the response. For example, to find the endpoint for the operators resource send a request to https://adminmanagement.<region>.<AzureStackdomain>/metadata/endpoints?api-version=2015-01-01 username - The Azure Stack AAD account, for example azurestackadmin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com password - The password for the Azure Stack AAD account scope - optional, such as openid to get the ID token For example: grant_type=password &client_id=1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2 &resource=(endpoint returned in the audiences section below) &username=admin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com &password=Password123 &scope=openid Note Format the request body using the Content-Type x-www-form-urlencoded . An example request might look something like the following curl -X \"POST\" \"https://login.windows.net/160f539f-8571-4c96-9361-797645c24e75/oauth2/token\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ --data-urlencode \"client_id=1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2\" \\ --data-urlencode \"grant_type=password\" \\ --data-urlencode \"username=admin@ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com\" \\ --data-urlencode 'password=Password12345' \\ --data-urlencode \"resource=https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/c0a3a144-57ae-42e2-a5da-19e945a25deb\" If the authentication is successful, the endpoint returns an access token. For example: { \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"scope\": \"user_impersonation\", \"expires_in\": \"3599\", \"ext_expires_in\": \"0\", \"expires_on\": \"1512574780\", \"not_before\": \"1512570880\", \"resource\": \"https://management.ukcloud.onmicrosoft.com/c0a3a144-57ae-42e2-a5da-19e945a25deb\", \"access_token\": \"eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" } You must include this token in the Authorization header of each subsequent API request. For example: curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOi...truncated for readability...\" 'https://management.local.azurestack.external/subscriptions?api-version=2016-05-01' Calling Azure Stack API endpoints A REST request URI consists of: <URI-scheme>://<URI-host>/<resource-path>?<query-string> where: URI-scheme is the protocol used to transmit the request, for example http or https . URI-host is the domain name or IP address of the server where the REST service endpoint is hosted, for example management.local.azurestack.external . resource-path is the resource or resource collection, which may include multiple segments, used by the service in determining the selection of those resources. For example beta/applications/00003f25-7e1f-4278-9488-efc7bac53c4a/owners is the resource path to a specific application's owners within the applications collection. query-string provides additional simple parameters, such as the API version or resource selection criteria. The syntax of an Azure Stack request URI is: https://management.local.azurestack.external/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group>/providers/<provider>/<resource-path>?<filter-expression>&api-version=<api-version> where: subscription-id is your tenant subscription ID resource-group is the resource group you want to query provider is the provider you want to query resource-path is the resource you want to query filter-expression is an optional list of arguments to filter the results of the query api-version is the version of the Azure Stack API being called, for example api-version=2016-05-01 For example, the following API call returns information about region health: https://management.local.azurestack.external/subscriptions/800c4168-3eb1-405b-a4ca-919fe7ee42e9/resourcegroups/system.local/providers/microsoft.infrastructureinsights.admin/regionhealths/local/Alerts?$filter=(Properties/State eq 'Active') and (Properties/Severity eq 'Critical')&$orderby=Properties/CreatedTimestamp desc&api-version=2016-05-01\" Next steps For general information about the Azure API, see the Azure REST API Reference at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/rest/api/?view=Azure In particular, you may find the following documents useful: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-code https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/azure-stack/azure-stack-provider-resource-api.md There is not currently an API reference guide for Azure Stack.

    "keywords": "How to create an Azure user group Overview UKCloud for Microsoft Azure provides you with three default user groups to get you started: AzureStackOperators - Members of this group have Owner permissions and have full access to all resources and can manage access to resources AzureStackUsers - Members of this group have Contributor permissions and can create and manage all resources but cannot manage access to resources AzureStackReadOnly - Members of this group have Reader permissions and can view everything but cannot make changes If these default groups do not meet your requirements, for example, if you've created a custom role and want to grant users the permissions specified by that role, you can create new groups and assign roles and permissions to them. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide you must have global administrator access to the Azure portal and Owner access to the Azure Stack portal. Creating a group for Azure users Rather than granting permissions to individual users, we recommend that you first create a group and add your Azure users to that group. To create a group in the Azure portal: Log in to the Azure portal as a global administrator: https://portal.azure.com Navigate to the Azure Active Directory . Tip You can find the Azure Active Directory by selecting All services and scrolling down to the Security + Identity section. Select Groups and then All groups . Click the New group option. From the Group type list, select Security . In the Group name field, enter a name for the group, for example, AzureStackGroup . In the Group description field, enter a brief, but meaningful description for the group. From the Membership type list, select Assigned . Click Create . To add users to the group, open the group, select Members then click Add members . Granting Azure permissions After setting up the user group in Azure, you need to go to the Azure Stack portal to grant the appropriate permissions to the group. To grant Azure permissions to a group: Log in to the Azure Stack portal: https://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/ Navigate to Subscriptions . Tip If you can't see Subscriptions in your favourites panel, click More services and then Subscriptions . You can add Subscriptions to your favourites panel by clicking the star icon. Select your subscription for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure. Select Access control (IAM) . Click the Add option. From the Role list, select the appropriate role that you want to assign to the group. In the Select field, enter the name of the group you created in Creating a group for UKCloud for Microsoft Azure users . Click Save .
